<Hash=0xB412CAF>	One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0xA1E882A3>	Wait second! That's only 5 votes, there are 6 of us here... Hey Ghoul, which way do you want to vote?
<Hash=0x7E31307>	Nice to meet you, Ghoul! I have a good feeling about you. I think you are someone that I can trust - I have knack of picking-up on these things...
<Hash=0xFCA84B3A>	I hope Toralei hasn't caught the Cat Flu. It's meant to be terrible!
<Hash=0xEB91D5D6>	I think I've heard enough! What's up with you ghouls? You'd have never considered keeping the money a week ago!
<Hash=0xF291E0DB>	That's the wrong vote, Toralei! What to do with the extra fundraising Money, remember?!
<Hash=0xFD815559>	OOOH-KAAAY!!! Thanks for that Toralei... Well, I'm happy to say it's all good news. The 2nd fundraiser exceeded all expectations. To use technical term, we made absolutely truckloads of Money! Not only will we have enough to repair and replace everything in Casketball Court, but we'll also have extra money left over for new 'To Do' list items that we're given by the students to improve the school! The Council should be proud. In a very short time we've been able to improve the student facilities at Monster High.
<Hash=0x7E997904>	What about funds for the repairs to the Casketball Court? Can we get the Ghoul to take the money to Bloodgood, so the improvements can be rolled out?
<Hash=0xFF81587F>	Do you have a question Spectra?
<Hash=0x1815BA5>	WHAT?!!!
<Hash=0x3815ECB>	Toralei, we can't do that!
<Hash=0xCC9550BF>	By King Tut's toes, get a move on Toralei! We can't start spending those 'dollar-dollar bills' until the vote's official and we're not getting any younger here! I can't wait to soak my furry foots in that bubbling warm water...aahhhhh!
<Hash=0x5734D08C>	How about we go out there and talk to the students to find out what they need and want? We could take notes and then make a list of projects based on popularity. I think this would be the fairest way for the Council to choose projects and prioritize them.
<Hash=0x5950CAA8>	Let's hope these flyers get the students excited enough about the Bake Sale. I want us to earn enough funds to start fixing things around Monster High!
<Hash=0xFD85B7B6>	Uh, Spectra, are you OK?
<Hash=0x9B7FE1A6>	Why not ask the Cooking Club to help us out? There's already tons of buzz around the school about the Fundraiser, so I'm sure that the Cooking Club would be happy to lend a helping hand or spatula.
<Hash=0xDED00453>	Hey, how did you do? Wow! That's a pretty heavy money bag, it looks like you've done great job of selling those cookies.
<Hash=0xE2D00A9F>	Spectra! Leave the Ghoul alone. You're not even supposed to be here, much less trying to handle the money. I'm Council Treasurer. That means I'm in charge of all of the Council funds. If you don't like it, you can always run against me in the next election.
<Hash=0xE1D0090C>	I'm sorry about that, I don't know what's up with her! It's sooo strange, usually she's more interested in the latest news than causing trouble. Oh well, don't take it to heart. Sometimes money brings out the worst in us!
<Hash=0xE4D00DC5>	Vot's up vith dat Spectra lately?! She's been totally cray-cray of late. But, trying to take da fundraising money, dat's too much!
<Hash=0x2998ABE5>	Hey everyone, I'm happy to say that the Bake Sale has been a HUGE success! Not only did we raise enough funds for a gigantic flat-screen TV for the Creepateria, but also to replace the seats - upgrading their cushions to plush top-of-the-line spider-silk. Additionally, there was even enough funds left over to repair the Vending Machines and re-stock them with BooBoo Fruits. All your hard work has paid off, you should all be very proud of yourselves!
<Hash=0x2298A0E0>	OK Spectra, that's enough!!! You're not getting anywhere near that money. So stop it, you're starting to freak us all out!
<Hash=0x2E98B3C4>	I hope all that wiggy stuff with Spectra didn't totally freak you out. The ghoul's been acting a few cards short of a deck lately. Ever since she started hanging around with Cleo, all that royal stuff seems to have gone to her head. Look, you're one of the people at Monster High that I know I can trust with the Money. Could you do me a favor and deliver the funds to Headmistress Bloodgood? I've got an appointment with the Scaredresser, so I won't be able to make it today. But if you can take it to her for me, the contractors can be contacted and the improvements made overnight...
<Hash=0x63F25AB5>	Considering we completely sold out of cookies at the last Bake Sale, I suggest we increase the quantity, so that we can raise even more funds. Additionally, we should probably change the type of cookies, so that the students don't become bored hmm?
<Hash=0x9A20F17C>	We've already discussed this once before Spectra. The answer is NO! Please don't bring it up again!
<Hash=0x151B27C4>	Oh, hello. We did better than last time, huh? OH MY GHOUL!!! That money bag is gargantuan! How are you lifting that thing?
<Hash=0x111B2178>	Catrine! Leave her alone. We've come to expect this whacked-out junk from Spectra lately, but not you! You know I'm Council Treasurer and I look after all of the Council funds. So, cool your jets and go away!!!
<Hash=0x141B2631>	I am really sorry, you shouldn't have to put up with that. Things have been crazier than usual 'round here and I don't have a clue what's going on! Maybe it's something in the water? But Catrine, it just makes no sense. We'd better start being extra careful when handling the Council funds. It's getting hard to know who to trust.
<Hash=0x131B249E>	I don't know why, but I really trust you Ghoul!
<Hash=0xB4A0A2B3>	One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0xC2A0B8BD>	Woo Hoooo! Go Spook'em! Yaaay! Booya! Hail to the King! Ra Ra Ra!!! Take it over! Spook'em rules! Curse 'em all! Yeah, monsters!
<Hash=0xC0A2F42E>	Woo Hoooo! Go Spook'em! Yaaay! Booya! Hail to the King! Ra Ra Ra!!! Take it over! Spook'em rules! Curse 'em all! Yeah, monsters!
<Hash=0x37AAE2CB>	Woo Hoooo! Go Queen Cleo! Yaaay! Booya! Go Cursed Ones! Ra Ra Ra!!! Ya smashed it! Cleo rules! Cursed forever! YAAAAYY!!!!
<Hash=0x3DAAEC3D>	Woo Hoooo! Go Queen Cleo! Yaaay! Booya! Go Cursed Ones! Ra Ra Ra!!! Ya smashed it! Cleo rules! Cursed forever! YAAAAYY!!!!
<Hash=0xA5FE4DB2>	HOOORRAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!
<Hash=0x9DECA474>	Woo Hoooo! Go Ghouls! Yaaay! Booya! A-NILE-8-ORS 4ever! Ra Ra Ra!!! You can do it! Come on! Show Cleo whats what! YAAAAYY!!!!
<Hash=0x38559214>	Elissabat, you've got food to finish. You'll have to find out what's up later.
<Hash=0xFDCCC09B>	Oh they're gonna love today's lunch!
<Hash=0x3CCCA0D>	What's up Deuce?
<Hash=0xCCC554>	Wha!? But we made Screamy mac and cheese.
<Hash=0x2CBC02DD>	!?
<Hash=0x2ABBFFB7>	Easy bro. Don't get your serpents in a twist. You act like you can cook or something.
<Hash=0x92BEE206>	Oh wow.
<Hash=0x97BEE9E5>	Sounds great!
<Hash=0x81446820>	Um... Yes.. I mean no... Wait, what are you making?
<Hash=0x83446B46>	Oh, then yes definitely put vinegrrr in!
<Hash=0x24DFACEB>	Yeah... but why do WE have to do it?
<Hash=0x20DFA69F>	Why me?
<Hash=0xA116309E>	Chopping onions!
<Hash=0x9A57EB90>	He's like a gorgonmanster possessed!
<Hash=0x268DDB49>	Elissabat! Now is not the time, get back on garnish!
<Hash=0xB56631F2>	You seem so confident. Alright, let's do it.
<Hash=0xFA3435D3>	Yeah, you can cut these onions.
<Hash=0xD67CA15E>	I've got onions ready!
<Hash=0x8F18C4C3>	Come on in my ghoul, I was expecting you! Abbey said that you'd be stopping by to drop off the Council fundraising money. So, how have you found your first week here at Monster High?
<Hash=0xF2021B18>	That's so good to hear my dear. It's great to see a new student taking to the school like a baby Krakken swimming in the deep blue sea. It makes me all warm and toasty inside, just like the sands of the Sahara...
<Hash=0xF5021FD1>	That's sooo disappointing to hear my dear. It makes me sad to think that such a talented student could be finding things 'strange' here at Monster High. I'm sure we can do something to rectify that. Maybe you should go and speak to Cleo in private? That way you don't have to feel embarrassed. I've heard she's got some great remedies for that whole 'Strange Freaking Out' thing. I mean, she is Head Fearleader after all!
<Hash=0x1A0498A7>	Ah yes! The money for the improvements to the Creepateria, the students will love that huge flat-screen TV. Thank you so much for that. I shall ring through that order for the Pyramid... er... I mean TV, immediately! It should all be sorted by tomorrow...
<Hash=0x1B049A3A>	Ah yes! The money for the improvements to the Creepateria, the students will love that huge flat-screen TV. Thank you so much for that. I'll shall ring through that order for the Sarcophagus... er... I mean TV, immediately! It should all be sorted by tomorrow...
<Hash=0x218C1939>	Ah... there you are! You must be the New Ghoul. I'm Ms. Bloodgood the Headmistress of Monster High. On behalf of the staff and students I'd like to offer you a warm welcome to the Campus. To help your transition into the school, I've assigned you a student buddy to show you around and introduce you to some of her friends. Her name is Spectra Vondergeist and she's a bit of a celebrity 'round these parts. You may know her as the blogger for the Gory Gazette, if that is your thing. Anyway, I've uploaded Spectra's location to your iCoffin MAPP. She's probably looking for her next big story. Who knows? It might even be you! Hope you have a spooktacular first day.
<Hash=0x9D289D3E>	I've never been better, my dear ghoul! Now let me guess, why you've come to see me. Let's see... You have something important to tell me. A curse spreading through the school perhaps?
<Hash=0x9F28A064>	Now, let me speak my dear. Ah, yes! There's an ancient Amulet and an old rival of mine who wants revenge! To take over the school! King Spookenkhamun, I believe! Are you following, my dear ghoul?
<Hash=0xA128A38A>	What?! How could I know all this? Well, that's easy, my dear! Spookenkhamun has cursed me too!!!
<Hash=0x94288F13>	Come and join me ghouls! Soon enough, you'll become... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0x93288D80>	Join us! One of us... One of us... One of us... Join us! One of us... One of us... One of us... Join us! One of us... One of us... One of us... Join us! One of us...  Join us!
<Hash=0x8A21C390>	Don't be frightened my little ghoul. It's soooo much fuuun being One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0x8B21C523>	Oh, come on now... don't run away! We could have so much fun, you and me. All of us. We could play mummify the student! I'd let you go first... or maybe you'd prefer petting my Cobra... He's not venomous at all... He actually likes to knit... please come back... pleeeeaaaaassssseeeeee...
<Hash=0x2F05AAE4>	ATTENTION STUDENTS!!! I must apologize about the fire alarm. It appears that it was a false alarm triggered accidently by one of the students. Please make your way back into the school. Sorry for the inconvenience... that is all!
<Hash=0xD4E0A899>	Oh my gore, what are you supposed to be?

The comic book club is making their own comic book hero? Oh that's fangtastic! You look great, I'll tell all my beasties.
<Hash=0x855AEBCF>	Come onnnn. Let's finish fast! I've got butterflies in my stomach, I'm so hungry!
<Hash=0xEA217DB4>	<name>, could you check on Deuce? He seems tightly coiled.
<Hash=0x8D5AF867>	Deuce?
<Hash=0x2E671498>	Yes please! Show us!
<Hash=0x7D81D6AB>	We don't put vinegrrr in this!
<Hash=0x2D64D46E>	Mm.... MmmmMMmMMMMmm.
<Hash=0x3264DC4D>	Alright!
<Hash=0x8281DE8A>	I'm making Shockolate Cookies.
<Hash=0x7681CBA6>	!?
<Hash=0x3DF8B884>	What about the vampires?
<Hash=0x580AC320>	I'm getting tired! I thought we'd just be baking cookies.
<Hash=0x576EEBEE>	OK I got the pots on for pasta!
<Hash=0xFB298916>	I had no idea Deuce could move like that.
<Hash=0x2990F5>	Wow Deuce.
<Hash=0x32F7D9F6>	Watch where you're putting that batula!
<Hash=0x281EC019>	Deuce, we're slammed. Can we really take on more work?
<Hash=0xA7668C6F>	It's already finished everything.
<Hash=0x1C5EF5D9>	Yaaaay!
<Hash=0x22087B2E>	I'm not ready for onions! Go get the squid!
<Hash=0x220EB96A>	One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0x7DC27654>	It has been done, oh omnipotent one! I personally delivered the message to each and every cursed student at Monster High. Better still, Cleo said that Spookenkhamun will use all of his powers to attract the cursed to the meeting, drawing them to the Auditorium, like a moth to a flame.
<Hash=0x7256420C>	Bonjour, it's really nice to meet ya! If you ever want to chat about art or fashion, be sure to hit me up. I really look forward to working with ya on the Council...
<Hash=0xFCE70999>	(whispered) One of us... One of us... Toralei is gonna be, One of us... One of us... One of us... She's on the Bus... One of us... In Sphinx we trust... One of us... One of us... One of us... The Amulet bites... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0x57192418>	We could always let them take a dip in the warm, bubbling waters of the Nile. That should keep them happy. If not, feed 'em to the Sphinx!
<Hash=0xFD6C101B>	Yeah, maybe you're right. I'm probably just a little homesick for Scaris. Wow, that was just a petite crazy... I don't know what I was thinking!
<Hash=0x76738A5B>	Posters, flyers and handbills, stuck up everywhere... It reminds me of the streets of Scaris, advertising art shows, performances and culture. Maybe the Boonighted States isn't so different after all!
<Hash=0x8428DFD0>	Here's a purrfectly radical idea! How about a Student Tax to use the bathroom facilities?
<Hash=0x17013CC5>	Feedback from the students I spoke to was spooktacular. Everyone seems to be really excited!
<Hash=0xB6172212>	Well, we are raising money to improve the Casketball Court. So why not keep to the theme and sell Casketball Cookies?
<Hash=0xEA7C2818>	Money!!! Give the Money! I'll take it! Gimme, gimme! King Spookenkhamun demands I protect this Treasure. So does the Sphinx and the Pharaohs. Relent, or their vengeance will reign down on Monster High!!!
<Hash=0xF07C318A>	You dare ignore my command?! The Sphinx will gobble you up and wreak havoc in these halls!!!
<Hash=0x5872A394>	Could I try a cookie? They look sooo scrumptious I can almost taste them with my eyes!!!
<Hash=0x55729EDB>	Sooorrrrryyyyyy!!!
<Hash=0x533A1AD4>	Well, it seems obvious to me that we need to find out what the cursed are up to. If they are being controlled by Spookenkhamun, there has to be some sorta master plan. Let's find out what it is, so we can jam a wrench in the works...
<Hash=0xC236CAC8>	Stop messing around! This is serious!!! Some of us are totally freaking out here!!!
<Hash=0xBF3904A6>	Sure, but how does that help us? Aren't we better off concentrating on Spookenkhamun's plan? The cursed are talking about a Mass Cursing at the Monster Nationals Fearleading Event, we have to stop that from happening and warn all the un-cursed students at the school!
<Hash=0xBD390180>	Yeah, I've got a plan! RUN!!! I totally hate curses! Let's get outta here while we still can, and get some outside help. It looks like this 'Spook'em' guy is getting more powerful with every student that he curses. How can we go up against a guy like that? It's game over ghoul! GAME OVER!!!
<Hash=0xBE45CF06>	We shoudda run!!! They don't understand, just how dangerous curses are. Spookenkhamun will be the end of us all!!!
<Hash=0x42ACC551>	I'll do it, it'll keep my mind off of all the crazy stuff that's going on!
<Hash=0x42AA86BA>	(whispered) Gotta keep it together Catty! You can do this...
<Hash=0x4760FF64>	We need some kind of diversion. Something to keep the attention of the cursed students busy for a while.
<Hash=0x3B4E7AEE>	I actually think we've nailed it! We can do this!!!
<Hash=0x344E6FE9>	Yeah! Who else would do these crazy missions and come back without a scratch?!
<Hash=0x4050C164>	Sure, Lagoona... I won't let you down!
<Hash=0x3F50BFD1>	Like clockwork... There was no one around, so nobody will have any idea of what we're up to...
<Hash=0x3B50B985>	(whisper) Just keep concentrating on the fearleading, let everyone else fade away. I can do this, I know I can! I'm no scaredy cat!!!
<Hash=0xF533AE0A>	That's gonna be easier said than done!!! That place is like a fortress jam-packed with cursed students... who's gonna draw that short straw?
<Hash=0xC586FF6C>	Chilling cheese fries.
<Hash=0x6453CD7B>	Of course it is! Everyone knows that curses are real...
<Hash=0x6653D0A1>	Funny you should mention that!
<Hash=0x6853D3C7>	Yeah! Ever since she got that creepy amulet for her birthday, stuff seems to be goin' the bizarre route. Ya know, it might be nothing. But every time I've seen her lately, the hackles on the back of my neck stand on end. It's really freaky stuff...
<Hash=0x6A53D6ED>	You don't think this is my fault, do you?
<Hash=0x5C53C0E3>	I know I'm superstitious... But I did break a mirror a little over a week ago. Just around the time that all this weirdness started spreading through the school.
<Hash=0xD45B3990>	If you say so...
<Hash=0xD85B3FDC>	Should we try to tell Headmistress Bloodgood what's going on? Maybe, she can help us?
<Hash=0xDD5B47BB>	OK, let's do it!
<Hash=0xB146186E>	Yeah, totally weird! No one is acting like themselves.
<Hash=0x6F585BFA>	With an ancient Egyptian curse like this, we're gonna need people we can trust!
<Hash=0xB574ACB0>	Sooo... you want to know what I think Monster High needs to improve to make things better for the students? That's easy. The Creepateria needs new seating and a big screen TV so that we can watch while we eat. The vending machines need to be repaired too!
<Hash=0x83C34A38>	You know, being asked what I think needs changing, makes me feel like an important member of the school!
<Hash=0xBF894597>	No, I don't think so.
<Hash=0x139D34E8>	A robot that can be my backup dancer on stage!
<Hash=0xA4385BCA>	Sooooo... it needs some kind of brain?
<Hash=0x97384753>	That's OK! <name>	will find it for us. Won't you <name>?
<Hash=0xDC088753>	Of course she did! She's purrfectly amazing!
<Hash=0xE1088F32>	Clawd, it's just a body. Everything that's going to happen is happening on the inside.
<Hash=0x24AFFE96>	Oh, like Dance Moves? Everyone can do it, but I do it because it makes me happy!
<Hash=0x1311D0F0>	Yay! Now it can learn to dance!
<Hash=0x1A11DBF5>	Huh!? That doesn't make any sense.
<Hash=0x46893CA8>	What's left to go?
<Hash=0xA30A64DB>	Whooooaaa! It just spoke!
<Hash=0x43DBE3D2>	And you can dance!
<Hash=0x41DBE0AC>	Total purrrfection.
<Hash=0xCB9EB680>	Even though it can't dance yet, it's still deadlightful! Watch this... Robot, what is 144 times 13?
<Hash=0x3FD99EEF>	Awww... So scary-sweet.
<Hash=0x8A89DE2F>	Excuse me? I have no idea what you're talking about.
<Hash=0x968C2FAA>	Wait... Iris, I didn't put anything in Manny's locker. You've mistaken me for someone else.
<Hash=0x948C2C84>	Who did the test?
<Hash=0xAC14520>	Way to go, <name>!
<Hash=0x9BE15F0D>	Hey we have a visitor.
<Hash=0x91E14F4F>	I think that'd be pretty hard, Catty.
<Hash=0xCCDC2CB2>	What do you mean?
<Hash=0x6D5401DE>	Hey <name>. Robecca was just telling us about power cells.
<Hash=0x83F0817>	Go ahead, <name>! You've done this before.
<Hash=0x63F04F1>	It is? Doesn't look like anything's happening. You sure those power cells weren't empty?
<Hash=0x606AA295>	Can we talk to it?
<Hash=0xA38C0A4F>	They're right here.
<Hash=0xCD1DB08F>	Yeah because you have all these new limbs to play with.
<Hash=0xD7A5EA41>	Runs without feet? Hm, my iCoffin runs without feet, but it gets tired when the battery runs out, so it can't be an iCoffin.
<Hash=0xCB4C6369>	Hey! It's great to meet a new member of the Team. If you ever want some fashion advice, be sure to hit me up, I'm always up with the latest and greatest. If only we could update the Fearleading outfits... it would be a dream come true. Anyways, have yourself a clawsome first pactice, and be sure not to take anything Cleo says to heart. She can be a little harsh at times...
<Hash=0xF2AE53E3>	A million stories? I had a book that had about 10 stories in it. Not quite a million, but maybe it's a clue.
<Hash=0x81516E69>	Well, that was a howling success! It looks like our newest member of the team, has more than a little talent...
<Hash=0xFAD9C22B>	Cleo's going to be late?! I guess she's just waaay too busy being pampered and showered in presents. Her dad really spoils her, she's his little princess and she really luxor-iates in it! It's classic Cleo!
<Hash=0x3CC96CD>	I gotta say, it is pretty Clawsome!
<Hash=0x6CEDA1D>	Oh boy, the strain must've been too much for her!!!
<Hash=0xF1D9B400>	Oh, come on!!! This is the first break we've taken today!
<Hash=0xDE4B694F>	That's right!!! Maybe all the pressure of trying to win the Monster Nationals is finally getting to her? I know she took it really hard when we came runners-up last year.
<Hash=0xE84B790D>	We were actually waiting for you 'fearless leader', but you were obviously too busy to grace us with your presence. Good to know we've got your support Cap!
<Hash=0x25C5BD53>	I guarantee it!!!
<Hash=0xD8492146>	Are you sure that Pyramid's name wasn't Spectra?
<Hash=0xD6491E20>	Well, you asked for it!!! A couple of us have seen you running around with Spectra, and yet, you don't have time to turn up to practice. When you do, you're late... What've you got to say about that!?
<Hash=0xCF32FEF4>	That's a weird clue! I don't know how to feel about that. Maybe it's like... something you would expect to be in the spot-light, like background props!?
<Hash=0xD446DC63>	You've gotta be kidding me!!! I don't know why we bother!
<Hash=0xD646DF89>	So, what did she say?
<Hash=0x39927A38>	I just can't believe she gets you to tell us to practice, while she runs off, doing who knows what. Well, at least she gave you the clue for the final set of fearleading moves.
<Hash=0x28C5C20C>	So you walked in on Cleo chatting with Spectra before the Council meeting? What happened after that?
<Hash=0x2EC5CB7E>	That's cray-cray even for Cleo! I mean she doesn't even get along with Spectra, especially after that Ghostly Gossip post which said that she and Deuce split up.
<Hash=0x92325FB0>	Has anyone seen Cleo?
<Hash=0x9732678F>	Let's split up, we can cover more area that way...
<Hash=0x252AF854>	Cleo? What's going on? You disappeared when the Fire Alarm went off and we all went looking for you. Is this your idea of a joke? If it is, it's really not funny!
<Hash=0x262D387E>	I'm really getting sick of Cleo's behaviour, maybe I should be head fearleader!
<Hash=0x94B1712A>	That's too much. Even for you, Cleo!
<Hash=0x90B16ADE>	You upset her and she ran off crying!
<Hash=0x4B8DD3F>	Nah, I think you better take it easy Cleo... Hey newbie, can you go after her?
<Hash=0x6B8E065>	Neeeeww Ghhooouuuuulll!!!
<Hash=0xD10188D2>	Great, we'll talk after practice. OK ghouls, times a wasting, we'd better hit that routine and see if we can give it some more polish. We'll get back to this, after we're done...
<Hash=0xD001873F>	Fantastic work ghouls, we're really starting to nail it! It's great seeing the team come together, when things are far from perfect around here.

Well, I guess it would be best for us to get this over and done with... We have to discuss Cleo! Her behaviour, and the incident with Ghoulia. So Ghoul, you went after Ghoulia yesterday. Why don't you get the ball rolling?
<Hash=0xCE018419>	Well that much is obvious. Cleo has been acting weird since her birthday!
<Hash=0xCC0180F3>	That little princess with her trinkets. She refuses to let that thing go! And blowing up at Ghoulia over it! Grr! It really grinds my gears!
<Hash=0xD901956A>	Well, we can't ignore it any longer. Cleo's been waay off base lately! I think we have to confront her for Ghoulia's sake...
<Hash=0xCF3DA0AA>	Draculaura's right! We're all feeling down right now, but the fact you turned up to practice after yesterday's blow-up, shows that you've truly become a part of the Team. We may get knocked down here and there, but it's the fact that we get up and move past it, that makes us better fearleaders.
<Hash=0xD703D0DB>	It's settled then! If Cleo turns up to fearleading practice tomorrow, we'll confront her about the fall out with Ghoulia and her strange behaviour in general...
<Hash=0xDD03DA4D>	The look on Cleo's face will be priceless!
<Hash=0xCC3D9BF1>	I don't think any of us are feeling comfortable with what's been going on around here. I can tell there's stuff you wanna tell us about your talk with Ghoulia, but maybe we should wait until after practice. That way, we won't be rudely interrupted by Queen Cleo, if she decides to grace us with her presence. Waddaya think?
<Hash=0xC63D927F>	Trust me, we don't want Cleo walking in on us while were discussing things. If you think the Ghoulia incident was bad, just imagine what Cleo'd do if she thought we were conspiring against her!
<Hash=0x9633ACA0>	I hate to say it, but there's no reasoning with her. We're gonna have to throw her off the team. She's not even making sense anymore...
<Hash=0x9C33B612>	We have! It's been unanimously decided that you're no longer the captain of Monster High's fearleading team. In fact, until your behavour improves, you're no longer a part of the fearleading team at all. We kindly ask that you leave...
<Hash=0xA033BC5E>	Well, I don't think we could've been any clearer.
<Hash=0xFBA4033F>	Don't worry, she'll be here! I dropped Cleo a SMS saying we had an urgent fearleading situation that needed the team captain's attention. No way she'd ignore that type of message...
<Hash=0x3130CF0A>	So, what should we do?!
<Hash=0x2E30CA51>	Agreed! Ghouls, it's important we stay safe and remain vigilant. We need to keep tabs on any clues to what might be causing all this weirdness. While we suspect that Cleo's Amulet is somehow involved, there has to be more to the story. With any luck, we'll get to the bottom of it and restore some sanity to the school. Is everyone agreed?
<Hash=0x2A30C405>	OK! Let's call it a day then. See you all at fearleading practice tomorrow. Things should be a lot more pleasant now that Cleo's gone!
<Hash=0x2D2E8A27>	With Cleo gone, now we can actually concentrate on fearleading!
<Hash=0xF7A3FCF3>	We need to talk to you about what happened yesterday between you and Ghoulia. It was totally unacceptable, the poor Ghoul was so upset by your behavior that she won't even come back to watch fearleading practice!
<Hash=0xF322B8FF>	Why would we do that? We all love Queen Cleo being the head fearleader of the team...
<Hash=0x16AE6562>	Deuce...
<Hash=0x293D7891>	NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! They can't do that! It's totally cheating... they're my fearleading moves! How dare they?! No one goes behind Queen Cleo's back... Nobody! Someone's gonna pay for this! They're all gonna pay!!! Those sorry excuses for fearleaders will feel my wrath! THE A-NILE-8-TORS WILL BE ANNIHILATED!!! I'm gonna crush all of them!
<Hash=0xC11BA77C>	(whisper)... (whisper)
<Hash=0xB5729B0D>	(whisper)... (whisper)
<Hash=0x2B2B2640>	WHAT DID YOU SAY!?!?!
<Hash=0x2E2B2AF9>	YES!!! The Team should have worked harder, instead of whining and complaining about how tired they were. Remember that, when you think I'm being too hard on you, 'coz I'll never let that happen ever again!
<Hash=0x2D2B2966>	But enough reminiscing, I have a little task for you to get things rolling. A way you can gain the team's respect and prove your commitment. This year's Monster Fearleading Nationals are just around the corner, and as you'd expect having a killer routine is half the battle...
<Hash=0x302B2E1F>	Age-old myths here at Monster High, tell of a legendary fearleading captain named Shiva Nataraja who led her team to Monster Nationals victory, 5 years running. Her secret? Ancient cosmic fearleading steps, that when combined into a routine, are said to be unbeatable! Shiva disappeared decades ago under mysterious circumstances, and with her, the mystical fearleading moves. However, rumours persist that the steps are hidden here at Monster High.
<Hash=0x2F2B2C8C>	Your first official Fearleading task is to find the opening trio of fear-steps - Tappa Tappa, Pop It and Bow & Arrow. The only clue we have to their location is a riddle. I know it's a little cryptic, but I'm sure you'll work it out!
<Hash=0x322B3145>	The riddle is, "What runs, has no feet, and never gets tired?" And the clue is "TWAER". Do you know what the answer is?
<Hash=0x342B346B>	Pity. Try asking the Fearleaders for help. Despite their constant avoidance of hard work, they can be somewhat bright at times.
<Hash=0x4600D93B>	Oh, my ghoul I think you've got it! WATER! I guess this means that the steps are hidden somewhere near water. The pool! That's it! Go get those steps!
<Hash=0x4700DACE>	Hm, I don't think that's right. Try again when you think you know the answer.
<Hash=0xBA23B898>	I don't think that's right. Wait, I think I've got this. W... A... T... The answer has to be Water! Think about it, it has no feet but is always running! I guess this mreans that the steps are hidden somewhere near water. The pool! That's it! Go get those steps!
<Hash=0xBB23BA2B>	Well, well... I must admit, I'm a little impressed! You just might have what it takes to become a fearleader, after all. OK ghouls, it's time to wrap up and call it day. Tomorrow, we'll start in on the cosmic fearleading steps. I'll expect you all nice and early for practice...
<Hash=0x2A492C17>	Ah! So, you're the New Ghoul I've heard so much about. Draculaura only had the nicest of things to say about you, she's sure you're true Fearleader material. Just remember though, Fearleading takes dead-ication, determination, lots of attitude and tons of practice. As far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out on you. But we'll see...
<Hash=0x1F491AC6>	To make it in the Fearleaders, you're going to need to push yourself. Show everyone what you're really made of! Trust me, you'll have lots of opportunities to do so...
<Hash=0x20491C59>	But first, I want to tell you a little story... Once upon a time, there was a talented Fearleading Team at a school very much like Monster High. They had a shot at the Monster Nationals, but their Captain felt pity for the team members during practice and didn't push them nearly as hard as she could. Do you know what happened when they finally competed at the Nationals? They came Runners Up!!!

So New Ghoul, after hearing my story, do you know what this team needs?
<Hash=0xEC42679D>	My, my... how the worm turns! And don't get me wrong Frankie, you and the New Ghoul, really are little worms. Two-faced, untrustworthy, troublesome worms, that should have been squished long ago!!!
<Hash=0xEA426477>	But I will!!! With this fearleading team I am in total control. Watch them... See their precision. Their moves are total perfection! Not only will I win the Monster Nationals, but I will rule Monster High!!!
<Hash=0xE8426151>	But I can and I already have! Right doesn't even come into it. I am Queen of this School, my power bestowed on me by the Pharaohs of old, my rule is absolute. Everything I do is right!
<Hash=0x53454859>	YEEEEESSSSSS!!! My dear, now you finally understand my absolute power over the fearleading team and it doesn't stop there. Soon Monster High will be my playground. It's students my little toys. However, like King Spookenkhamun, I am a merciful ruler and may have some use for you yet. Both of you amuse me with your silly talk of right and wrong. Walk away now, while you still can and never return to fearleading practice...

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! BY THE POWER OF THE SPHINX YOU ARE BANISHED! RETURN AND MY ANGER WILL KNOW NO BOUNDS!!!
<Hash=0x543525AC>	Nice to see you all here nice and early for a change ghouls. Maybe we actually have a chance of taking out the Monster Nationals after all. Anyhoo, the good news is that the newest member of our team has surprised me... imagine that... by recovering the first set of fabled cosmic fearleading steps. These mystical steps will give us an edge against the competition, namely Creepy College, who stole the trophy from us last year. So, lets get to it ghouls! I want you to be able to perform these fearleading moves in your sleep.
<Hash=0x2BAA3494>	That's good, 'coz this is gonna be a lot harder than last time! If you haven't already guessed, I'm going to send you on a hunting expedition for the second set of cosmic fearleading steps. This trio of moves is - Lunge, Tabletop and Touchdown. Once again, there's a riddle to point you in the right direction.
<Hash=0x2CAA3627>	The riddle is "What has a million stories, but cannot tell them?". The clue for this riddle is BLAIRRY. Have you figured it out?
<Hash=0x2DAA37BA>	WOW!!! You're a lot better than I expected! I actually thought I might never see you again. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled you found the cosmic fear-steps, it's just as Captain I'm used to being disappointed! I'm really glad you surprised me! Well, I guess you'd better get going. Oh, and by the way, before I forget, could you please tell the ghouls I'll be a little late for practice tomorrow? It's my Birthday, so just get them to start practice on the new moves without me...
<Hash=0x2EAA394D>	That's a shame. Keep at it, and remember you can ask some other people if you need more clues.
<Hash=0x99E6AA8B>	LIBRARY! Of course! A million stories. You're a clever one. This must mean the steps are in the Library. Go and get the steps!
<Hash=0x9AE6AC1E>	Hm, you know I don't think that's quite right. Something about the order of the letters is wrong.
<Hash=0x28AA2FDB>	I don't think that's right, but I had a thought! A book has a story, but doesn't tell it. A million books would probably make a library though. Wait, the clue! LIBRARY! This must mean the steps are in the Library. Go and get the steps!
<Hash=0x513520F3>	Now, now ghouls, let's not go overboard! It's true that the New Ghoul has a smidgen of talent and is mildly entertaining to watch in action. However, she still has a long way to go before she can count herself one of the elite in the fearleading community. That said, you do all seem to work well as a team.

Good work ghouls, let's call it a day...

New Ghoul? Do you have a moment to chat?
<Hash=0x50351F60>	Ah my ghoul, thanks for staying back. I wanted to say that I was impressed with yesterday's performance in recovering three of the cosmic fearleading steps. So impressed in fact, that I have another extra-scare-icular assignment for you.

Do you think you're up to the task?
<Hash=0x52352286>	Don't you want to be an elite Fearleader?!
<Hash=0x5C353244>	There are no buts in Fearleading!!! You're either up to it or your not, in which case you shouldn't be wasting my time. So I ask you again, are you up to the task?!
<Hash=0xAF4D7B0F>	Oh my Ra!!! A bunch of clawsome stuff, but my favorite has to be this gold amulet. It's a priceless artifact that has been passed down from mom's side of the family for hundreds of years. It really rocks my style, dontcha think?!
<Hash=0xAC4D7656>	Best of all, the purple gemstones complement my eye shadow, they're simply stunning. I find it hard to take my eyes off them!
<Hash=0xAB4D74C3>	Whoa! I'm feeling a little woozy... You know what ghouls? I think I'm gonna call it a day, maybe go home and have a bit of a lie down. I tell you what. Since it is my birthday, why not treat yourselves and break early too. We can pick up our training tomorrow.
<Hash=0xCEBD7B01>	Good afternoon ghouls, hard at work, I see!
<Hash=0xC8BD718F>	I have little doubt it was. How are things coming along?
<Hash=0x36427B94>	SO, what's more than JUST a COINCIDENCE!!!
<Hash=0x2C426BD6>	So why are you ghouls yammering instead of practicing? You do know that the Monster Nationals are less than two weeks away?!! Don't you want to take out the trophy, rather than re-living the embarrassment of coming in 'runners up', like we did last year?!!!
<Hash=0x2E403065>	I don't need to explain myself to you or anyone else! If you must know I needed to see someone about a Pyramid, so I was running a bit late...
<Hash=0x2C402D3F>	What are you on about Clawdeen?! If you want to say something, just come right out and say it!
<Hash=0x2A402A19>	Oh, Clawdeen... I don't know where you hear this stuff from, but I've not talked to that nosy blogger in ages! You know that Spectra and I don't get along at the best of times, so I try to avoid her whenever I can . You're making absolutely no sense at all...

You know what? Think what you like! I'm not sticking around to listen to this. You guys, just better start taking your practice seriously. I'm outta here!!! New Ghoul, follow me. I want to talk to you...
<Hash=0x29402886>	Oooohhhh!!!! I'm soooo angry!! Those ghouls, they're just not taking this competition seriously. Spending their time chitchatting instead of practicing, it's gonna be a repeat of last year and I hate losing!

Look, I know you're new, but you've come through for me with the last two sets of cosmic fearleading steps. At the very least I can tell you're trying, which is more than I can say about everybody else.

So once again, I'm going to leave recovering the final set of moves in your capable hands. Can you do that for me?
<Hash=0x27402560>	Do. Or not do. There is no try!
<Hash=0x36403CFD>	OK... So, this one is really difficult. To solve the final clue that points to the location of the cosmic fearleading steps, you will really have to flex those 'mental muscles'. This trio of moves are the most complex of all. If we want to win, we will have to master Spirit Tuck, Herkie and Double Hook.
<Hash=0x35403B6A>	The riddle is, "I'm in the spot-light every night, but I've never put on a single performance. What am I?", the clue that goes with it is EGATS. Have you got the answer?
<Hash=0x293DE9EF>	That's understandable. Take your time, and don't forget that you can ask those... ghouls over there for some help.
<Hash=0x7A76AA8A>	STAGE!? Of course! A stage can't perform, even though the spot-light is always on it! Now where would a stage be in Monster High? Oh, the Auditorium! It must mean there! Go get those steps!
<Hash=0x7976A8F7>	Hmm, no that's not quite right. I have a feeling that you're close though.
<Hash=0x7876A764>	Hm, that doesn't seem right. EGA, STA.. Hm, wait.. ST... STAGE! The answer is stage! Now where would a stage be in Monster High? Oh, the Auditorium! It must mean there! Go get those steps!
<Hash=0x2A3DEB82>	Oh my Ra! You've done it! You're much more loyal than these other ghouls! I can't believe they would accuse me of something I haven't done! I'm leaving, tell those ghouls to practice without me.
<Hash=0x526AE305>	That's fangtastic work!!! How did you ever solve that riddle? It was a brain-buster! I'm so glad you came through, now we might actually have a chance of taking out the Monster Nationals Fearleading Trophy... That really would be something!
<Hash=0x7F3C3A0E>	Whatever do you mean, my dear ghouls? I haven't moved from this spot...
<Hash=0x803C3BA1>	Well my ghouls, it seems you're all flustered by the Fire Alarm going off. It's understandable, I suppose. I hazard to guess that continuing practice would be a total waste of time. Too much excitement for your pretty little heads to process, no doubt. Why don't you all head off home and get some rest. We'll meet up again for practice tomorrow at LUNCH...
<Hash=0x793C309C>	Sometimes, I wonder why I even try with these ghouls!
<Hash=0x506ADFDF>	What are you talking about?
<Hash=0x4E6ADCB9>	What about Spectra? You know we don't get along, I hardly ever even speak to that ghoul - don't want to end up in her blog! Why would you think I'd get upset over her?!
<Hash=0x4C6AD993>	Sure, what 'evs... Now onto important matters, time to get training ghouls. The Monster Nationals are just around the corner and we finally have the last three fearleading moves. Now we can practice the whole routine. Let's get to it!!!
<Hash=0x596AEE0A>	Come on ghouls, that's the fire alarm. Drop everything and get out of here!!
<Hash=0x80D148C0>	Oh, the newbie finally decided to grace us with her presence! Think you're too good for practice, are you?! Got time to waste on other school activities like the Council. Don't think I don't know that you spend more time there than you do here! Turn up to Fearleading Practice late again and I'll throw you off the team!!
<Hash=0xB975D1D0>	I don't know why I even bother, considering all the brain puffs you eat, you'd think that you'd be a bit smarter than that... I guess not!!!
<Hash=0xBA75D363>	WHAT!? Does anyone have something to say?
<Hash=0xBE75D9AF>	What's going on?! Why's everyone looking at me like that? Where's Ghoulia gone?
<Hash=0xC075DCD5>	But I didn't... I don't remember that...
<Hash=0xC275DFFB>	Oh no! What have I done?! I've gotta find her...
<Hash=0x82D14BE6>	NO TALKING!!! If you can fearlead and talk at the same time, you're not doing it hard enough! Come on ghouls, step it up, we can't afford to be sloppy. And you, that's shoddy form... Lift those arms up high... higher! That's it, feel the burn!!!
<Hash=0x85D1509F>	Yes! YES!!! THAT'S IT! Pure perfection!
<Hash=0x84D14F0C>	Wait... Where's my amulet? I've dropped it!!!
<Hash=0x86D15232>	WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?!!!
<Hash=0x89D156EB>	NOOOO!!! That's mine, get away from me! Only Egyptian royalty may touch the amulet, how dare you put those grubby zombie mits on my birthday pres...
<Hash=0x68B4CE47>	HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MY ULTIMATUM??!!!
<Hash=0x66B4CB21>	TRAITORS!!! REBELS!!! BETRAYERS!!! HEED MY WORDS... YOU WILL ALL PAY FOR THIS INSOLENCE. NO ONE AT MONSTER HIGH WILL ESCAPE... AND BY THE MIGHTY SPHINX, QUEEN CLEOPATRA AND KING SPOOK'EM, WE WILL CURSE THIS SCHOOL, MAKING IT BOW TO OUR WILL!!!
<Hash=0xD687C71A>	Well, well... What do we have here? Four fearful fearleaders waiting for their Queen, like the four sides of a solitary Pyramid lost within the sands of the Sahara. Take away the base - that's me, if you didn't already guess - and it all comes tumbling down...

So ghouls, why have you summoned me from my increasingly busy schedule. I have Pharaohs to see and jewels to try on. What is so important that the fearleading team demand the Queen's majestic presence?!
<Hash=0xCA87B436>	ENOUGH!!! Royalty has no friends... I have NO problems other than the disobedient servants standing before me. I demand you do my bidding. Practice the cosmic fearleading routine immediately, so your Queen may be bestowed the golden trophy of Monster Nationals! Do so now or feel my wrath!!!
<Hash=0x1F0EE494>	Well, well... What do we have here?!
<Hash=0x220EE94D>	You'll have to do better than that my ghouls, if you hope to be fearleaders...
<Hash=0x140ED343>	Whatever do you mean? I'm the captain of the fearleading team! I'm here to put you ghouls through your paces...
<Hash=0x8A073E40>	What are you talking about silly ghoul?! No such thing happened yesterday. Did it, Clawdeen and Draculaura?!
<Hash=0x900747B2>	That's fine my dear. Take your time.
<Hash=0x92074AD8>	Oh, I didn't realize you were leaving too New Ghoul.
<Hash=0x100A4FC9>	Very well.
<Hash=0xB0093F3B>	One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0xBB2D2FB2>	Look, why don't we just kick this Spook'em's you-know-what'em?! I can't even talk reason to Cleo anymore, she's a completely different monster!

The same with all the cursed students. It's light's on, nobody's home! We've really gotta stop this crazy Pharaoh and save our friends!
<Hash=0x2921C813>	OK, I guess another day won't hurt.
<Hash=0xB92D2C8C>	How about if I remove my shades and go in blazing?!
<Hash=0xB72D2966>	Of course, not! But we can't just stand here doing nothing...
<Hash=0xD8E6C58E>	Calm down Catty, there's gotta be a way we can turn the tables and save all our friends. Hmmmm... Why don't we use what we know about his plan against him? We know, that they're hoping to do a mass cursing at the Fearleading Nationals. Specifically, after Cleo and her team of Cursed Fearleaders win the competition. So, we know exactly when and where they'll make their move. All we have to do is strike first. Stop them when they're least expecting it. That way, we'll have the element of surprise on our side!
<Hash=0x4DEE3982>	I'm the man with a plan! Now, I've just gotta sort out the deets!!!
<Hash=0x5E35E021>	That's where me and Clawd come in. We can run a 2 point trap defence on her and get that amulet out of her reach.
<Hash=0xC4437956>	Well, from the intel we know that my scary-sweet Cleo is under Spook'em's influence and she's the one with all the cursing mojo. If we want to defeat King Spook'em and protect the un-cursed students in the Gym, we're gonna have to slow her down. Lucky for us, I'm Cleo's biggest weakness! I've got that stoney glaze that rocks her world.
<Hash=0x3B3A994C>	You're up Clawd...
<Hash=0x3E3A9E05>	NOW NEW GHOUL! DO IT!!
<Hash=0x9B830DCD>	Hey Cleo, how about those A-NILE-8-ORS right?
<Hash=0x653F3BE4>	Nevermind! It's... it's nothing. I need some air.
<Hash=0x613F3598>	Grrr! I'm usually stone cold cool about these things... But, it's just so frustrating watching awful food being served in the Creepateria. And the worst part is that the student bodies don't know how bad it really is!
<Hash=0x1B86870D>	I can't! Then they'd know... Nevermind.
<Hash=0x18868254>	No worries, ghoul. I've gotta figure this out on my own.
<Hash=0x643F3A51>	Wait! I know what to do... but I'm going to need your help. I need you to find me some Purple Scarrots. They grow outside near the graveyard. Bring them to Cooking Club tomorrow.
<Hash=0xCE21D662>	<Grumble>
<Hash=0xC821CCF0>	Nothing.
<Hash=0xD521E167>	Without even a pinch of salt!?
<Hash=0xE4C0F710>	I'm just watching you all make these horrific mistakes! And it's making my snakes stand on end!
<Hash=0xE6C0FA36>	YES! I can cook, OK? And you know what? I'm Clawsome at it, dude.
<Hash=0xE8C0FD5C>	Because... I didn't want anyone to know. But can I show you a couple of things?
<Hash=0xEAC10082>	<name>, you got the scarrots right?
<Hash=0xEDC1053B>	That rocks! Now watch - let me show you how it's done!
<Hash=0xECC103A8>	Now taste this!
<Hash=0x76B98E21>	This soup is on the menu tomorrow. We have more than enough scarrots to make it for everyone.
<Hash=0x79B992DA>	Thanks, <name>. I couldn't have done it without you. I don't know why I was so afraid to tell them. Well, tomorrow is a new day, and I feel like a new monster.
<Hash=0xA235D9A7>	Nooooooo!!! I can't take this anymore!
<Hash=0xA30EE3C6>	Come on people, we have to move faster.
<Hash=0xA670DC42>	What do you need, <name>? We're a little busy in here today.
<Hash=0x5AA65FC7>	Heh, thanks. You know what... since you're here, I could actually use your help.
<Hash=0x5BA6615A>	Actually yes! You can.
<Hash=0xA570DAAF>	I need some fresh garlic for a special scareghetti I want to make. Find me some garlic and bring it back here.
<Hash=0xA270D5F6>	Thanks so much, you're saving my scales ghoul! This garlic looks scary-delicious.
<Hash=0xA070D2D0>	Good point... We'll have to let the vampires know that the scareghetti has garlic in it.
<Hash=0xA170D463>	Thanks again for the help <name>. Come back some other time. We could always use the extra claws.
<Hash=0xA10EE0A0>	Well, we have to feed the hungry student bodies of Monster High.
<Hash=0xA70EEA12>	Because, practice makes perfect... Elissabat, would you mind?
<Hash=0xA50EE6EC>	Invisi Billy, please cut the onions.
<Hash=0xAB0EF05E>	Because you're invisible... so you can cut it without shedding a tear! Or, at least we won't see it if you do.
<Hash=0x74A87E0B>	Oh! <name>, you're just in time! We're making the special now!
<Hash=0x82B94B80>	Great! Scurry back once you're done.
<Hash=0x85B95039>	That's cool. We can do it later.
<Hash=0xDE3EB3BB>	Ah, you're back. What did you find out?
<Hash=0xDD3EB228>	Whoa! That's a coffin load of boo foods to try. This is going to be great. Thanks for the help.
<Hash=0x75A87F9E>	Hey guys, let's get going on the scareghetti!
<Hash=0x79A885EA>	Pretty creeperific, right? It's like a well-coiled machine. In fact, I think we could take on more work.
<Hash=0x7AA8877D>	And I was thinking... what if we cooked students' favorite dishes? That would be sick!
<Hash=0x6BA86FE0>	<name>, I need you go get around and ask the students what some of their faves are. We're going to give them the total scream of the crop.
<Hash=0xF8202590>	Hey! <name>, wow, am I glad you're here. I need you to do something for me.
<Hash=0x3D9B3F99>	Done!
<Hash=0x409B4452>	Ah it's no big deal.
<Hash=0x419B45E5>	(Whisper) Thank you! I couldn't have done it without you.
<Hash=0xFC202BDC>	Yeah... So that's happening. I think we bit off more than we could chew with this one. Honestly, we're in trouble.
<Hash=0x6FAA98D9>	I know! Look, there's only one way we're getting through this, and that's with your help.
<Hash=0x6CAA9420>	Please don't go. We're in enough hot water as it is and I need your help!
<Hash=0x12033BB>	I need you to find Gigi! She promised me a wish a while ago. Time to call that in.
<Hash=0x203228>	Go now... Hurry! Ask Gigi to help us through it!
<Hash=0x4A585A15>	Oh, hey <name>. What brings you to the cooking club?
<Hash=0xEA7CCBFA>	Great! Just bring it back here once you've found it.
<Hash=0x2D15E6AC>	Thanks! Come back tomorrow and we'll get those treats ready for the Fashion Club.
<Hash=0x7110418A>	Oh, the Fashion Club need some treats for their show? That's cool.
<Hash=0x465853C9>	Sure we can! This team can do anything.
<Hash=0x445850A3>	We'll need some ingredients to get started on it.
<Hash=0x5158651A>	I need you to hunt down some Eye-Scream for us.
<Hash=0x514D4214>	Well, we can't do anything without it. Come back if you change your mind.
<Hash=0x3850EC50>	Wait... The Robotics Club built a functioning Robot? That's fangtastic! Great idea. Talk to Robecca and see if we can borrow it.
<Hash=0x3B50F109>	I bet Robecca can come up with a plan... go ask her if there's anything she can do for us.
<Hash=0x2A845737>	Wow... That's scary-cool.
<Hash=0x6CCF68E7>	No! Elissabat, get the pasta.
<Hash=0x208208E2>	DON'T VANISH ON ME NOW, INVISI BILLY, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
<Hash=0x1F82074F>	<name>, this is incredible! The Robot just turned up and... and... finished everything! Thank you! You really helped us out of a bind there, not to mention saved the fashion show!
<Hash=0xBBACBD58>	Well, I've learned my lesson. Don't bite off more than you can chew.
<Hash=0xBEACC211>	Thanks <robotname>. We couldn't have done this without you.
<Hash=0x1B820103>	Yeah... let's fly over to the fashion show to support the ghouls.
<Hash=0x69CF642E>	Squid? We're not even making squid!!
<Hash=0x68CF629B>	Oh, <name>. Bad time, what do you need?
<Hash=0xEC72AC7C>	Yes, look I know! But, there's no way we can finish all this.
<Hash=0xEF72B135>	Jinafire is just going to have to wait! We're just too busy right now. There's no way we can finish all this.
<Hash=0x65CF5DE2>	Hey, if you can think of some way we can get through this, then I'd be eternally grateful.
<Hash=0xDDC72946>	Hey there Newbie! I've been hearing some good rumors about you. Sounds like you're really starting to leave your mark here at Monster High - keep it up! Sooo, let me guess why you're here... I'll wager that the Council needs the Cooking Club to help with the Bake Sale and that Toralei sent you over because I owe her one. Am I right?!
<Hash=0xC036BD04>	I knew it!!!
<Hash=0xC336C1BD>	Really?!! My radar must be on the fritz... Hmmmm... you're pulling my leg, aren't you?
<Hash=0xEBC97DE7>	Nice try New Ghoul. Toralei sent me a text about it earlier.
<Hash=0xE8C9792E>	That Toralei, she never forgets doing anyone a favor. That's why she makes a great Council President. She's always got an IOU or two up her sleeve to get things rolling. Just between you and me, everyone's so jazzed about the Fundraiser, the Cooking Club would've helped anyway. But keep that between us, what Toralei doesn't know won't hurt her, and it means that it's one less that I owe her. I'll have those Creepilicious Cookies to you by tomorrow's Council Meeting...
<Hash=0xE9C97AC1>	Sheesh, students keep coming to me about cooking stuff. Better be careful to keep it under wraps. I love it, but it's gonna wreck my rep as the school's 'Number 1' jock!!!
<Hash=0x89F361E7>	Oh, OK... Well no time to fang out today, sorry. Gotta bounce.
<Hash=0xF926ADD>	Hmmmm, if you're not here to try some of my tasty treats, that only leaves Council business. Let me guess. You're here to ask the Cooking Club for help again. You'd like us to bake up some Casketball Cookies for the next Fundraiser. Am I right?
<Hash=0x337975E2>	Hah... I got it in one! Toralei's, still got a few IOUs up her sleeve. Same deal as last time? You keep quiet about the fact that the Cooking Club's jazzed about the Fundraiser, and I'll get rid of another favor that I owe Toralei... Sound good?
<Hash=0x3279744F>	Nah... I'm not falling for that one again! Fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on me... again? Sheesh... I never get that right!
<Hash=0xB926491>	Yeah, why not have a laugh at the expense of the gorgon? It's not easy looking this cool while rockin' an apron, ya know?! That's why I like keepin' my culinary exploits on the down low. Gotta keep up appearances!
<Hash=0xA9262FE>	Same deal as last time? You keep quiet about the fact that the Cooking Club's jazzed about the Fundraiser, and I'll get rid of another favor that I owe Toralei... Sound good?
<Hash=0x8925FD8>	WOW!!! Double the order, the Council are really looking at changing things for the better around here. It's a good time to be a student at Monster High. I'll get those Casketball Cookies over to you by tomorrow's Council Meeting...
<Hash=0x7925E45>	Man, gotta love that flat screen TV in the creepateria. Now I can watch my fave show Ever After High, while I'm eating lunch. Just can't let anyone know my guilty little secret!
<Hash=0x2FB564D9>	Hey Ghoul, it's you again! Couldn't resist my cooking, right?
<Hash=0xCEA71F42>	You've got a biting sense of humor, New Ghoul.
<Hash=0xCDA71DAF>	Ouch! Well, that wasn't the confidence booster I was hoping for.
<Hash=0xC2BAED1C>	Hey! New Ghoul, it's good to see ya again! Have you thought any further about joining the Fearleading Team? Fearleaders are the coolest ghouls in school and we help to boost Team Spirit at sporting events.

I think you'd make a fangtastic member of the Fearleading Team. You've got the right look and with a little hard work you'd learn the routines in no time. You never know, there's even a chance you could become the Captain of the Fearleading Team. So how about it? Would you like to join the Fearleaders?
<Hash=0xD7AF01A9>	Hi, it's nice to meet you! So, you're thinking about joining the Fearleading Team. A lot of people don't know this, but it's not just about learning Fear Routines. Being a Fearleader is actually all about boosting school spirit - it's one of the most important things a ghoul can do. So, lets catch up later and I'll put in a good word with Cleo the Team Captain.

Oh, by the way, have you met Lagoona yet? No? Oh, I just have to introduce you! She's a part of the Student Council, so if you're interested in that sort of thing, she's your ghoul!
<Hash=0xD6AF0016>	Hey Lagoona, over here! I'd like you to meet the New Ghoul. I was telling her all about Fearleading and thought she should meet you in case she'd like to join the Student Council too...
<Hash=0x6EFE3892>	That's totally fangtastic! I can already see that you'll be a great addition to the Team!!! Look, I've got a few errands to run before Fearleading starts at LUNCH. How about you meet me there, and I'll introduce you to the Team. I've updated your iCoffin MAPP with the deets. I'll catch ya there!
<Hash=0xEB5C1034>	Really well! We've almost got everything locked down with the 2nd set of cosmic moves and the routine's really starting to come together. Oh, by the way, Happy Birthday Cleo!
<Hash=0x703CB0C7>	Oh a clue? Hmm, let's see... TWAER. Is that some kind of dance? Maybe REAWT... No, I don't think that's a real word.
<Hash=0xDF71942>	We sure have! I'm the one who put in a good word for her with Cleo. It's fangtastic that you made the team, the Fearleaders can always use some new blood! I just can't wait 'till we start practicing some new routines, it's gonna be scary-cool...
<Hash=0xB7FDDE69>	I heard a million stories from my grandfather, but he could tell me them, so I guess the answer isn't him.
<Hash=0xDB90AD3B>	She sure does! I just knew she was going to fit right in. She's totally fangtastic!
<Hash=0x60A62713>	Sure is...
<Hash=0x468F98F3>	What's that all about?
<Hash=0x66A63085>	Well, it's pointless complaining about it. It's like this every year...
<Hash=0x64A62D5F>	You're right, Frankie... Anyway, we'd better get started practicing that second set of cosmic fearleading steps. If Cleo turns up and we're not practicing, we'll never hear the end of it!!!
<Hash=0x333FC2EB>	Where is Cleo! Do you think it's gonna be a repeat of last year?
<Hash=0x865FBB9B>	That just makes no sense... I mean, what would Cleo be doing at the Student Council, anyway? Weirder still, why was she talking to Spectra? And running off without saying a word, well, that's just not Cleo! It's downright bizarre!!!
<Hash=0x8C5FC50D>	True! Cleo loves to win, but she thrives under pressure. I can't believe she'd crack. But, what's really weird is, I saw her talking to Spectra this morning, just before lunch!!!
<Hash=0xC53F2652>	That riddle is familiar. It's probably got something to do with acting, or dancing or something. Maybe the clothes that models wear?
<Hash=0x353FC611>	Hey New Ghoul, have you seen Cleo around?
<Hash=0xF864EC3F>	Enough with the Cleo stuff already. Let's get this practice pumping!!!
<Hash=0x373FC937>	Hm, that's strange. What was she doing at the Council?
<Hash=0xE4BC45E6>	Not since we passed the Creepateria. Where could she have gone?!
<Hash=0xE7BC4A9F>	Sounds good! New Ghoul, you head back to the Casketball Court. Clawdeen, you try the Classrooms, Frankie, you check the Study Howl, and I'll head for the Library...
<Hash=0x77C3E914>	That's right! We actually thought you might have been lost or injured. That's really not cool Cleo!
<Hash=0x6EC19C52>	Cleo seems to be getting worse... What is going on around here?!
<Hash=0xBEB77708>	Come on, begore it's too late!
<Hash=0x4A909732>	And all over your silly amulet... that's harsh!
<Hash=0xADA4AD5A>	Hey, don't look so gloomy, the fearleaders have been through much worse before. I'm sure it'll all blow over soon.
<Hash=0xC73D0297>	Other times when she got upset she would bounce back in a couple of days. Not this time...
<Hash=0xBE3AB5D5>	I agree! I think we need to speak with Cleo sooner rather than later. It's like she's getting worse and worse with each passing day...
<Hash=0xBA3AAF89>	I just hope, it doesn't make things worse...
<Hash=0xB73AAAD0>	Nothing could be worse than they are now!
<Hash=0x302BBA1A>	Nup! It's not you. She's gone totally 'ga-ga' on us!!!
<Hash=0x2B2BB23B>	Well, that went well, didn't it?!
<Hash=0x172DD156>	Get serious ghouls, Cleo actually called us a bunch of traitors!!! She's obviously got a few screws loose, no offence Frankie.
<Hash=0x162DCFC3>	I think you're right we'd better be extra careful. Cleo's kooky behaviour definitely wasn't normal, so we should try to get to the bottom it. Keep our eyes peeled and ears to the ground to find out what's happening out there in the halls of Monster High...
<Hash=0x192DD47C>	I'm in!
<Hash=0x1D30195F>	Boy, I hope this means less drama in the fearleading team!
<Hash=0x8CC08DB0>	I really don't know. But I do think, it's one of the few options left to us. If we do nothing, someone could actually get hurt. We can't let that happen...
<Hash=0x8FC09269>	Not to mention, the way you've been treating the rest of us lately. No fearleader should have to put up with that sort of behaviour...
<Hash=0x9FDECCCD>	So true! If Her Majesty wasn't here, we wouldn't have a chance to win the Monster Nationals. Cleo helps us be the best fearleaders we can. We should be thanking her, not throwing her off the team!!!
<Hash=0xF759724A>	HHHEEELLLLLPPPP!! ROCHELLE IS STUCK IN THE GRAVEYARD! CAN ANYONE HELP?
<Hash=0xF65970B7>	Rochelle! Don't be afraid, we're trying to work something out...
<Hash=0xF15968D8>	Our hero has come to save the day!
<Hash=0x208F60C5>	Something seems terribly wrong. I should go after him.
<Hash=0x908FF02F>	A little bat told me that yesterday's lunch caused a few visits to the school nurse.
<Hash=0x35A59C67>	Bonita, did you remember to add the vinegrrr?
<Hash=0xC6B516A9>	Why didn't you say anything? We could obviously use the help!
<Hash=0xCEB761D8>	Oh this is going to blow the lid off the casket in the creepateria!
<Hash=0x37A59F8D>	Invisi Billy! Do we put vinegrrr in this?
<Hash=0x2CA58E3C>	!?
<Hash=0xB81D4259>	Just a sec...
<Hash=0xB352FAF9>	Reducing the tomatoes!
<Hash=0x52AA1F0D>	That was pretty impressive.
<Hash=0xD82C3DC4>	Oh, it's a Cooking Club catastrophe!
<Hash=0x1310264>	Soooo, I guess that's a wrap for today?
<Hash=0xE8F678C7>	Hello... excuse me, but could I trouble you for some help? I'm about to put on a solo performance here, and I've been practicing my lines for days now.
<Hash=0xB3006CD5>	It's been a big part of my life. But you can't do it alone, it'd be too hard. Why, no one could even enjoy it without... Er... Line?
<Hash=0x71A68F4A>	without friends!
<Hash=0x70A68DB7>	without... spoons.
<Hash=0xB000681C>	Because I like to dig deeper, and get to the bottom of it. Because I want more... I want to have a full... (Uh... Line?)
<Hash=0x819E59B5>	a full life!
<Hash=0x7E9E54FC>	a full... breakfast!
<Hash=0x599BDC26>	Ghoul! You really saved my veins! You are the wind beneath my batwings.
<Hash=0x589BDA93>	That was OK... I guess. Thanks for your help.
<Hash=0x579BD900>	Total disaster! I can't believe that went so horribly!
<Hash=0x6DBE8DE4>	Nailed it like a coffin! Thanks again for your help!
<Hash=0x70BE929D>	I'm getting there. Hauntlywood, here I come... again!
<Hash=0x6FBE910A>	Looks like Breakfast speaks to people as much as purpose. Who knew?
<Hash=0xE9F67A5A>	I just need for someone to know the lines I get stuck on and prompt me if it looks like I'm having trouble. Can you do that?
<Hash=0x65F327AB>	OK Great! Thank you! Now I need you to remember the following words.
<Hash=0x66F3293E>	Oh, I understand. Well, maybe you could come back when you have the time.
<Hash=0xE4F6727B>	Purpose, Friends, Life.
<Hash=0xE5F6740E>	OK, are you ready? Let's do this.
<Hash=0xE6F675A1>	The internal drive, the infinite thirst for meaning is what pushes us into the light. I couldn't be here today without... Uh... line?
<Hash=0x71EC7ECA>	without purpose!
<Hash=0x70EC7D37>	without... grapefruit!
<Hash=0xED9C29C7>	10... 10... 10...
<Hash=0xEF9C2CED>	(cheering) THREE CHEERS FOR OUR FEARLEADERS: FRANKIE, LAGOONA, CATTY... AND OF COURSE, THE NEW GHOUL!!! HIP, HIP... HOORAY!! HIP, HIP HOORAY!!!
<Hash=0x11EF3514>	Yeah, it seems like the smartest move.
<Hash=0xE11E719B>	It's not that we don't agree with you, Deuce. It's just, we only have one chance at this, so it has to be done right! If we mess this up, we'll be handing over the school and all of our friends on a silver platter...
<Hash=0xE71E7B0D>	That could make things even worse. We don't know how Spookenkhamun would react to a direct attack. He could hurt everyone under his control. You wouldn't want that, would you?
<Hash=0xE51E77E7>	And we won't! But we need to think very carefully about our next move...
<Hash=0xDA1E6696>	That sounds good to me, as long as we all play it safe. We really need the intel, but not at the expense of our allies becoming infected with the curse...
<Hash=0xBEC3888E>	So, let me get this straight?! This King Spookenkhamun guy completely took over Toralei and then spoke through her mouth? How totally freaky is that?
<Hash=0xBCC38568>	So, what do we do then?! It's easy enough to warn the un-cursed students at Monster High. But, how do we actually stop Spookenkhamun's plan from happening?!
<Hash=0xC3C3906D>	Well, that's all well and good Deuce. But we still have to come up with a plan. If we mess this up, the whole of Monster High will be under Spookenkhamun's control...
<Hash=0xB6C37BF6>	We've gotta come up with something that won't fail, everyone is counting on us!
<Hash=0x2559F91>	Well, I know Cleo pretty well, and... well, remember when she dropped her amulet in Fearleading Practice? She was overcome with how amazing we were. If we can do that again, then we can distract Cleo!



 We could set up a new Fearleading Team and go up against the Cursed Fearleaders at the Monster Nationals! The New Ghoul and I already have the routines down, so we can get a couple of volunteers and train them up in no time. Any takers?
<Hash=0x559C6B>	Great! They definitely won't be expecting that! Now, if we can keep the team under wraps until the actual Fear-off and we put on a fangtastic show, Cleo and Toralei will totally lose it!

And if we do happen to win, all the Cursed students won't know what to do with themselves. They'll be waiting for Cleo and the cursed fearleaders to get the winner's trophy, before they make their move. If that happens, Spookenkhamun's plans will completely fall apart! After all, orders are orders...
<Hash=0x6C588506>	So, when do we start?
<Hash=0x6A5881E0>	Great job everyone! We need more practice, but it was a great start! If we keep this up, even Cleo will be blown away! Let's meet up again after school and keep going!
<Hash=0x6B588373>	We can do this! I know we can! We got Cleo to drop the Amulet once and we'll do it again!
<Hash=0x64961920>	Ghoulia, and I, put our heads together and have come up with a pretty solid theory! Using the information we've gathered from the Hieropedia, we believe that all of this first started when Cleo received the Amulet from her father.

Her Amulet was pictured in the book, and the legends say that Spookenkhamun was imprisoned inside it, as punishment, by the Monster School Administrators.

He's obviously found a way to spread his 'control curse' using the Amulet. Ghoulia thinks that if the Amulet is destroyed, the curse will be made useless. Everyone will turn back into themselves. We think that this is our best chance - perhaps our only chance - to save the school!
<Hash=0x70962C04>	Wow, that's a totally great idea! But what could we use as a diversion?
<Hash=0xC8BB9512>	Come on New Ghoul. You're the best ghoul for the job! And we're all relying on you!
<Hash=0xC7BB937F>	Oh, thank you! You be extra careful Ghoul! We can't afford to lose you...
<Hash=0x829D9EF7>	That's over $100 per fearleader! None of us have that kinda cash, what are we gonna do?! We need the money by end of the day, so that we can enter the Monster Nationals...
<Hash=0x5E20E840>	We're almost there! Everything's coming together, all we have to do now is pull off the Cosmic fearleading routine to perfection!
<Hash=0x7B9D93F2>	As long as we stick together and work as a team, we've got this licked!!!
<Hash=0xE0025BBF>	You really think so, Lagoona?
<Hash=0xDE025899>	So, what next?
<Hash=0x9D51C3D4>	АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя
<Hash=0x7EAB6AF7>	No worries, I just thought I'd check. I'm always happy to lend a helping hand.
<Hash=0x7FAB6C8A>	OK... well it's really simple. First press <WHITE>&icoffin;</WHITE>	to bring up your iCoffin. Then choose an option from the Menu using <WHITE>&select;</WHITE>. You'll see Contacts, Messages and Maps. Select the MAPP option to bring up the school map. To exit the map, press <WHITE>&back;</WHITE>	and you'll put your iCoffin away.
<Hash=0x8CB7617F>	You know, being new and all, you should probably head on over to the Office to see Headmistress Bloodgood. No doubt you'll need to sign in or something. I've updated your iCoffin MAPP with the location of the Office. You'd better get going, you don't want to keep Bloodgood waiting. She might... um... lose her head!
<Hash=0x9F51C6FA>	Are you sure?
<Hash=0x9951BD88>	With a dead-pan sense of humor like that, you're gonna fit right in!!!
<Hash=0x9C51C241>	Welcome to Monster High, it's really nice to meet you! I love it when the school gets new blood, there's always a chance of making new friends...
<Hash=0x9B51C0AE>	Oh before I forget, you might find this new updated version of the iCoffin MAPP handy. It'll help you find your way around campus...
<Hash=0x9651B8CF>	Would you like me to explain how to use the iCoffin MAPP?
<Hash=0xE5513D88>	Hey, there you are! Draculaura, said that you'd be coming by. Let me introduce you to the Fearleading Team...
<Hash=0xD63B77A1>	Oh, I'm great at riddles! But this one is hard! What runs, has no feet... could it be a RIVER? Hm, no those letters don't appear to be part of the clue.
<Hash=0xE8514241>	There's no need to be shy, we're all friends here! The members of the Fearleading Team are just like a family. First up, we have my GFF Draculaura, who I believe you've already met...
<Hash=0xEA514567>	Next is my other GFF, Clawdeen. She's a werewolf, but don't let that scare you off. She's really into fashion and deep down she's just a puppy at heart...
<Hash=0xEC51488D>	Last, but certainly not least, we have Cleo the Fearleading Team's Captain. So, I guess you could say she's the 'mummy' of this family. Cleo's a really competetive spirit and a true perfectionist. She might be hard on us a lot of the time, but all that tuff-luv has made us far better Fearleaders, than we ever thought possible...
<Hash=0xD3358740>	Thanks sooo much for coming to the Gym early. All this has been really freaking me out! I got here and I heard weird noises coming from inside the Gym. I wasn't even game to take a peek, until you arrived! Who knows what's going on in there?
<Hash=0xEE4436E3>	But why? Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to win the Monster Nationals!
<Hash=0xF0443A09>	You can't do this! It isn't right!
<Hash=0xF2443D2F>	Come on ghouls! Snap out of it! Clawdeen! Draculaura! Spectra! Catrine! Please wake up! Snap out of it! Say something, say anything!!!
<Hash=0xFF4B0D6B>	NNNNNOOOOOOOO!!!!
<Hash=0x14B1091>	That was waaay too close!!! It's just gotten real. There's something walking through the halls of Monster High, spreading its own brand of crazy, at an alarming rate. If we don't do anything soon, it'll take over the whole school!
<Hash=0x34B13B7>	So, whadda we do next?!
<Hash=0x1134C9F4>	So, Ghoulia knows something more about all this. Well, we need to find her!
<Hash=0x1434CEAD>	What about Ghoulia? I mean she's the smartest ghoul I know... she's sure to know more about what's going on here.
<Hash=0xF74B00D3>	I'm going to find her! Come and talk to us when you can.
<Hash=0xF64AFF40>	Hey! New Ghoul, you made it!
<Hash=0xD5358A66>	Alright, but I'm following your lead. You're a braver ghoul than I am...
<Hash=0xFA48C6F5>	Ghoulia, was just telling me what she'd dug up about Cleo's Amulet...
<Hash=0xF848C3CF>	Come on Ghoulia, tell the New Ghoul what you discovered about the Amulet!
<Hash=0xF348BBF0>	Great! Let's do it! I'll see you both there tomorrow at LUNCH.
<Hash=0xF448BD83>	I hope nothing else kooky happens between now and tomorrow AFTERNOON!
<Hash=0xD8358F1F>	Right... are you ready?
<Hash=0xDC35956B>	Oh it's alright. I'll be there right beside you if anything happens. Alright, come on!
<Hash=0xDB3593D8>	OH NO!!! Cleo, what's going on here?! Why are there new fearleaders practicing? It's so close to the Monster Nationals, it'll be a disaster to change the line-up!!!
<Hash=0x597747FE>	Wow, these pages don't paint a pretty picture. Let's see here... Thousands of years ago, King Spookenkhamun was the Headmaster of Pharaoh High, where all of Egypt's monsters and mythical creatures attended school. Unfortunately, like so many Kings, he yearned to rule the World. His role as Headmaster gave him access to students with incredible powers, so he began possessing them via a Curse and started assembling an army to do his bidding.
<Hash=0x5877466B>	His plan was stumbled upon by a younger Headmistress Bloodgood, who was visiting Pharaoh High to set-up a student exchange program. She reported him immediately, to the Monster School Administrators. As a result, Headmaster Spookenkhamun was banished into a gold amulet, where he could no longer harm, students, teachers and the Monster-World at large.
<Hash=0x577744D8>	It turns out, the gold amulet was inherited by Cleo's mom, from her estranged brother Spookenkhamun, when he disappeared without a trace. Of course, only Bloodgood and the Monster School Administrators knew where he really was. Trapped in the gold amulet for an eternity, no doubt planning his revenge...
<Hash=0x5D774E4A>	I think there's only one thing we can do. We need to warn Bloodgood. Show her the pages of the Hieropedia and tell her that her old nemesis Spookenkhamun is out to get her. Who knows, she might even call in the Monster School Administrators as back-up!
<Hash=0x5B774B24>	Yeah, that should work! How about this, tomorrow we meet outside Bloodgood's office. Then, we go in, show her the Hieropedia and she'll fix everything.
<Hash=0x5020108E>	So, does this book have a name?
<Hash=0xDC7A54CE>	A week!? We don't have much time!
<Hash=0xDA7A51A8>	Yeah, but in the meantime, be extra careful, it's becoming scary out there... and not in a scary-cool way!
<Hash=0xC77C7256>	OK then, better get some rest ghouls. We'll meet up again, tomorrow!
<Hash=0xCA7C770F>	Wow! The newbie is one brave ghoul, I don't know how she does it.
<Hash=0x53201547>	Hm, maybe someone doesn't want us to get to the bottom of what's going on at Monster High... Let's split up and look!
<Hash=0x542016DA>	Hey Ghoulia, I think I've found something! You said that the Hiero-thingy was bound in bandages, didn't you? Is this it?!
<Hash=0x47200263>	Hey Ghoulia, look what I found! I think this might be one of the pages you're looking for. It's got a picture of an artefact that looks exactly like Cleo's gold amulet. Does this help at all?
<Hash=0xC7A8612A>	Hey guys! So Ghoulia, how'd you do with the research? Do you really think we can stop this Spookenkhamun guy and break the curse?
<Hash=0x6610D8C8>	Ms. Bloodgood, are you OK?
<Hash=0x6C10E23A>	Huh!? But, how could you?
<Hash=0x6A10DF14>	Yes, but wait! How could...
<Hash=0x600E90BF>	Oh NO! Bloodgood's cursed!
<Hash=0x5E0E8D99>	Whadda we do now?! That plan's totally out the window. Without Bloodgood on our side, we're gonna have to stop this thing all by ourselves. Any ideas ghouls?!
<Hash=0x5B0E88E0>	OK then, Ghoulia, you continue doing more research, hopefully you'll find something that'll help. To make sure we know what's happening at the school, I'd suggest we do a little recon too.

Tomorrow, I'll go and spy on Cleo and the fearleaders, while the New Ghoul can search for some new recruits that haven't been cursed. How does that sound?
<Hash=0x690E9EEA>	Yeah well, desperate times call for desperate measures. It's time for all of us to monster up!!!
<Hash=0xC5A85E04>	And that's exactly what we don't have! OK ghouls, let's go tell Bloodgood what's happening.
<Hash=0x5D0C4D6F>	Let's get to it then! We'll go our separate ways and meet up tomorrow.
<Hash=0x5E0C4F02>	I can't believe I sounded so confident! Especially when all of this is sooo scary!
<Hash=0xA4CF2185>	(SMS via iCoffin) HEEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPP!!!! STUCK IN GYM. CURSED EVERYWHERE. CAN'T FIND WAY OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN. COME QUICK!!! F. =(8-o)
<Hash=0x29121315>	So, how've you been going with recruiting un-cursed students? I hope it's better than my fumbled attempts at covert intel gathering.
<Hash=0x231209A3>	Oh thank goodness Lagoona and Catty are OK.
<Hash=0x25120CC9>	OK! A meeting of the un-cursed in the Library after school, so we can come up with a plan of action. That sounds great! I'll be there with bolts on. Be careful out there, I'll see you then...
<Hash=0xA1CF1CCC>	(hushed) Thanks for coming for me. I was sure I was a goner! There was no way I was getting out of here, without being caught. So what's the plan?
<Hash=0x9FCF19A6>	(hushed) Ghoul, you're a sly one, aren't you? The Fire Alarm is pure genius. When everyone evacuates, we'll be able to walk right outta here...
<Hash=0x57058F8C>	There! The Fire Alarm. If you pull that, then maybe we can buy some time to get out of here!
<Hash=0x9DCF1680>	Boy, that was close! Thanks for saving me!
<Hash=0x5677F34F>	I know the answer! It's Fearleading Camp! When you come away from Fearleading Camp you have a million stories! But you're not supposed to tell anyone any of them! Hm, but I suppose the clue "BLAIRRY" doesn't spell out Fearleading Camp.
<Hash=0x5BB5B99>	Happy birthday! So, did you get any cool presents?
<Hash=0x3BB5873>	That's totally voltageous! Cleo, you really pull it off...
<Hash=0x9EB87ADD>	Gee, I hope she's alright.
<Hash=0xB901166C>	Yeah, we all expected as much. Cleo's always late for practice on her birthday...
<Hash=0xB7011346>	Well... I mean, considering it's her birthday, who can blame her for being a bit late?!
<Hash=0x10202FCE>	Twice in one day, something strange really is going on! But what can it be? It's gotta be more than just a coincidence...
<Hash=0xE202CA8>	OH BOLTS!!! It was nothing... just a rumour I heard about some freshmen student. Don't worry about it...
<Hash=0x6216A1A0>	Hm, EGATS is the clue? Why would a spot-light be on someone if they're not performing? Unless it's not a someone!?
<Hash=0xEFCBA40C>	STOP!!! Where's Cleo?!
<Hash=0xF2CBA8C5>	Well, we've got to find her!
<Hash=0xEDCBA0E6>	Be careful everyone, good luck!
<Hash=0xBE2F882D>	Are you feeling OK Cleo? You seemed pretty upset when you left fearleading yesterday...
<Hash=0x81D345A7>	Oh Cleo, you're safe! I was really worried.
<Hash=0x78D3377C>	I'm really starting to worry about Cleo, memory loss can't be good!
<Hash=0xB82F7EBB>	You know, all the stuff about Spectra. No one meant to get you upset and we were really worried about you...
<Hash=0xBA2F81E1>	Maybe I'm just getting confused... Don't worry about it.
<Hash=0x66F76F57>	The poor ghoul didn't know what hit her. Ghoulia is your friend... we all are, and you've been acting so mean lately. Is this fearleading competition really that important?!
<Hash=0x5AF75C73>	Trust us Cleo, you did. We all saw you lose it...
<Hash=0xEA6780E0>	She's been like this all day... there's no escaping her!
<Hash=0x5465C6B2>	There's little doubt that Cleo's changed. She used to be a hard task-master, but now she's become downright mean. What she did to Ghoulia was totally unacceptable, but what can we do about it?
<Hash=0x5463881B>	Sounds good...
<Hash=0x58638E67>	I worried at how Cleo will react!
<Hash=0xEDE92D8>	Hey, did you find Ghoulia? Is she OK?
<Hash=0x14DE9C4A>	That doesn't sound good. This should never have happened!
<Hash=0xB936D6EB>	Boy, I hope she actually turns up! Whadda we do if Cleo doesn't come to practice?!
<Hash=0x6C543AC1>	Ghouls... Is it just me or has Cleo totally lost it!
<Hash=0x6D543C54>	Do you think she got the message?
<Hash=0x63542C96>	What about all that weird Egyptian stuff Cleo was spouting and the crazy threats against the school? Do you think we should be worried?
<Hash=0x6F567E11>	Yeah!
<Hash=0x6B5677C5>	I'm sooo worried about Cleo, she really isn't herself!
<Hash=0xBB36DA11>	Are you sure that confronting Cleo is the best way to handle the situation?!
<Hash=0xB036C8C0>	Please Cleo! Tell us what's happening. Why have you been acting so weird? Is everything alright at home? We're your friends, we just want to help you!
<Hash=0x3CAE7E70>	Hey, you know I'm really looking forward to practice today.
<Hash=0xC6B0BEC0>	You know what... we're probably just overreacting! They could have just slept in, or decided on having a lazy day... Let's start practicing without them.
<Hash=0xC8B0C1E6>	Do you get the feeling someone's watching us?!
<Hash=0xCDB0C9C5>	Cleo!!! What are you doing here?!
<Hash=0xCFB0CCEB>	What's going on?!! Yesterday, we decided to kick Cleo off the team and now you guys are acting like you want her back as captain. I don't understand...
<Hash=0x59B861EE>	(whisper) What should we do?
<Hash=0xD847B72F>	Good idea! Let's go!
<Hash=0xD947B8C2>	Oh dear. I've left a book in the study howl, I'll need to go and get it.
<Hash=0x4FB85230>	Oh, it's like a really heavy book... like, really heavy.
<Hash=0x3EAE8196>	As much as I like Cleo, her behaviour was really making fearleading a high drama. It kinda sucked the fun outta everything! Oh! Hm, I wonder where Clawdeen and Draculaura are. They should have been here by now...
<Hash=0x53B619E5>	That was close! I can't believe Clawdeen and Draculaura have changed!
<Hash=0x4CB60EE0>	We have to turn up to Fearleading Practice tomorrow, for their sake! Draculaura and Clawdeen were on our side just a couple of days ago, but now...
<Hash=0x5AB624EA>	Meet me at the gym before practice begins, I don't want to get caught in there by myself!
<Hash=0xE3BDB85A>	Please be careful! I'm really starting to get scared now...
<Hash=0x40AE84BC>	You don't think we should be worried, do you?
<Hash=0x45AE8C9B>	Yeah, you're probably right. Let's just start practicing without them. I'm sure they'll turn up soon.
<Hash=0x54AC267A>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Gotta, finalize this plan, we need to reverse the curse!)
<Hash=0x4EFB432C>	GROAAAN!! (Welcome to the Comic Book Club! While I usually prefer to start meetings in a more punctual manner, it appears we are missing one important member. Operetta has not arrived yet.)
<Hash=0x728AA6A7>	GROOAAAANN (It is defrightful to have you with us.)
<Hash=0x6D8A9EC8>	GROOOAAANNN!! (This may take a while. Slomo, do you mind hanging out to assist?)
<Hash=0x6F8AA1EE>	GROOOAAANN!! (Thanks for the help <name>. I do not think you will need to hang around. I foresee this taking quite a long time.)
<Hash=0x51FB47E5>	GROAAAAN!! (Her absence is indeed quite puzzling. Would you mind tracking down Operetta to unearth the reason for her tardiness?)
<Hash=0xAE82B656>	GROAAANNN!! (Thank you for your UHHH-mazing help!)
<Hash=0xAD82B4C3>	GROAAANNN (Oh, sure I UHHH-nderstand. Let me know if you find the time.)
<Hash=0x230F4671>	GRROOOOAAANN!! (Today I have something thrilling planned. I want the comic book club to create their own comic book hero.)
<Hash=0x720B9853>	GRROOAAANNN!! (How about you <name>, what kind of powers do you think that our super hero should have? Let us choose from some options. Super Speed, or Super Intelligent?)
<Hash=0xC64526C8>	GRRROOAAANN!! (A superhero after my own undead heart! But do they fight crime using their Wits or their Fists?)
<Hash=0xC9452B81>	GRRROAAANN!! (Great, so our superhero oozes with intelligence, but does she have mind reading abilities or can she shoot lasers from her eyes?)
<Hash=0xD24B49DA>	GRRROOOAANN!! (Fangtastic, a super fast hero that uses their wits to take down crime! That sounds great! What does everyone think?)
<Hash=0xD14B4847>	GRRROOOAANN!! (Fangtastic, a super fast hero that uses their fists to take down crime! That sounds great! What does everyone else think?)
<Hash=0xD04B46B4>	GRRROOOAANN!! (Creepy-Cool! A super smart hero that uses laser eyes to take down crime! That sounds great! What does everyone else think?)
<Hash=0xCF4B4521>	GRRROOOAANN!! (Creepy-Cool! A super smart hero that uses mind reading to take down crime! That sounds great! What does everyone else think?)
<Hash=0x7A0BA4EB>	GROOOAAANN!! (So now that we know the powers... our hero needs a heroic name! <name>, pick a name for the hero).
<Hash=0x1042AAB>	GRROOOAANNN!! (If everyone is happy with that, then I will start drawing up some sketches. Everyone, put your heads together and think of a way to promote the comic book!)
<Hash=0x270F4CBD>	GRROOAAANNN!! (What UHHH-mazing suggestions. Deadfast is my favorite comic book hero because he is brave, dashing and most of all, incredibly fast. It would appear that we all prefer heroes who are not like ourselves.)
<Hash=0x250F4997>	GRROOOAANNN!! (You talked about a hero with an uncanny ability to excel in tight places, well... is it not true that you experience claustrophobia?)
<Hash=0x25E853B6>	GRROOAAAN!! (So I put together some sketches of <heroname>, and I even had time to make a superhero outfit.)
<Hash=0x29B92F30>	GRROAAAANN!! (Oh wow, a real emergency, right when we needed one! Not only did you just save Rochelle, but no one is going to forget the name <heroname>	now! Good job <name>.
<Hash=0x23E85090>	GROAAANNN!! (Not only have I constructed an outfit, but I have also concocted quite an elaborate plan of attack. If we are going to release our comic book, then we could get someone to wear this and spread the word!)
<Hash=0x28E8586F>	GROAAAANN!! (This is why I asked <name>	to attend today. <name>, could you try on the <heroname>	outfit?)
<Hash=0x2DE8604E>	GRROOOAAANNN!! (Well, it would be ideal if <name>	could go out there and do something heroic, but that implies some kind of problem. Perhaps you could just talk to a few people, and introduce yourself as <heroname>?)
<Hash=0x6C895691>	GROAAAANNN!! (You posted them all already? That is UHHH-mazing! Be sure to come to the book signing too. This comic is as much yours as ours).
<Hash=0xF981F121>	GROOAAANNNN!! (Yes, the book signing is a great idea! We can pass out copies of the book and really promote <heroname>. Great suggestion Neighthan.)
<Hash=0xFC81F5DA>	GROOAAAANNN!! (They look fangtastic! We could hang them up all over the school so everyone knows when the book signing is happening!)
<Hash=0xFD81F76D>	GRROAAAANN!! (<name>, could you hang these posters up around the school?)
<Hash=0xB753626>	GRROAAAANN!! (I cannot thank you enough, <name>. You are such a big help.)
<Hash=0xA753493>	GROOAAANNN!! (That is OK, we can do it some other time when you are free.)
<Hash=0x7B976640>	GRROAAAANNN!! (The turn out is UHHH-nbelievable! I hope we have enough comics to give out.)
<Hash=0x82977145>	GRROOAAANNN!! (That sounds scary-cool! I will get to work on it tonight.)
<Hash=0x81976FB2>	GRROAAANN!! (Thanks, <name>. You helped show everyone how much fun comic books can be - and that is what I really wanted to do all along.)
<Hash=0x911E216F>	GROOOAAANN!!! (It's really good to see you Ghouls, especially since you're still acting like your old selves.)
<Hash=0x8F1E1E49>	GROOOAAANN!!! (The truth is even more unthinkable than all of the crazy events of the past few days. The best way to explain it all, is to show you. There's an ancient book in the Library, that I believe, holds all the answers! We should meet up there, tomorrow AFTERNOON. How's that sound?)
<Hash=0x9B1E312D>	GROOOAAANN!!! (The Nekri-comic-com is gonna blow their minds!!!)
<Hash=0xBD9C00F2>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Hey ghouls, I'm glad you made it! Come on, the book I was talking about is in the archives...)
<Hash=0x3E953166>	GROOOAAANN!!! (That's it!!! One of the missing pages of the Hieropedia. Good work Frankie. From what I can tell, there are 5 more pages that have been torn from the book. We need the info they contain ghouls, so lets get to work...)
<Hash=0x429537B2>	GROOOAAANN!!! (That sounds about right! What better way to get back at Bloodgood, than to take away everything she loves. Her students and Monster High itself. It also gives that loon another shot at taking over the World! So... What do you think we should do?)
<Hash=0x4095348C>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Sounds like a plan. Let's take the pages to Bloodgood, then work out our next play from there. Everyone agree?)
<Hash=0x9FF3A6D0>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Don't worry New Ghoul. Headmistress Bloodgood isn't scary. She's probably the best ally we could have right now.)
<Hash=0x56931897>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Great plan, Frankie. We'll meet up outside Bloodgood's Office at lunch, and talk to her together.)
<Hash=0x539313DE>	GROOOAAANN!!! (That's right! More and more people are acting strange every day! By my calculations, this curse will completely take over the school in about a week.)
<Hash=0xBB9BFDCC>	GROOOAAANN!!! (It's called the Hieropedia. It's ages old and is actually bound in the bandages of a real Mummy. I found several references to Cleo's gold amulet... Now, just to find it again...)
<Hash=0x4F90CEFB>	GROOOAAANN!!! (I'm totally wrecked, time for a good night's sleep!)
<Hash=0xBA9BFC39>	GROOOAAANN!!! (It was right here! It's gotta be here somewhere. Let's see if we can find it...)
<Hash=0xB79BF780>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Yes, that's it!!! Now... It's just a matter of finding the right pages...)
<Hash=0xC69C0F1D>	GROOOAAANN!!! (NO, No... This can't be right!!! All of the relevant pages are gone! It was all there... solid evidence... the amulet, the curse, Spookenkhamun, his vendetta against Bloodgood, and all of the info needed to stop it!)
<Hash=0xC437E196>	GROOOAAANN!!! (I have little doubt we can break the curse, it's just a matter of finding the right clue to show us how. Unfortunately, as of yet, nothing in the pages has pointed me in the right direction. It'll just take some time...)
<Hash=0x88F836BF>	GRROOOAAANN!! (There goes our strongest ally.)
<Hash=0x86F83399>	GROOOAAANN!!! (For starters, I have to find a way to reverse the effects of the curse. That means I've gotta hit the books and search the pages again for any clues.)
<Hash=0x8FFA805B>	GROOOAAANN!!! (You said it ghoul!!!)
<Hash=0x90FA81EE>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Gotta hit those books hard! The answer to ending the curse must be hiding in there somewhere...)
<Hash=0x6ADBE00>	GROOOAAANN!!! (I don't know what I did wrong. Cleo's been so weird lately. It's like she's a completely different person... and she's not the only one! There's something strange going on at the school...)
<Hash=0xCADC772>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Do you have any idea of what might be causing this weird behaviour?)
<Hash=0xFC8BD2D7>	GROOOAAANN!!! (You know what? I think you might be onto something. All this weirdness did start around the time Cleo got that Amulet for her Birthday!)
<Hash=0xFD8BD46A>	GRROOAAAANN!! (You know, I think this really started around her birthday when she got that amulet. She's been different ever since.)
<Hash=0x11ADCF51>	GROOOAAANN!!! (So what to do? I'm pretty good at research, so I could hit the books. See if I can turn something up on the Amulet.)
<Hash=0x3AB7AB0>	GROOOAAANN!!! (If you keep an eye on Cleo, and bring the other fearleaders into the loop, then I'll hit the Library and see if research can turn up any clues.

How about we meet up again, when things have calm down a bit? When we do, I'll let you know if I've found anything.)
<Hash=0x5AB7DD6>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Thanks for coming after me, you're a real friend. Take care, we'll catch up soon...)
<Hash=0xFDAA107F>	GROOOAAANN!!! (Here you go Cleo, you dropped your Amul...)
<Hash=0x2AA185E>	GROOOAAANN!!! (But... but... I was only tryi...)
<Hash=0xBDFA132B>	Yeah me too! I can imagine how they can use their freaky-fab powers to their advantage.
<Hash=0xBBFA1005>	<heroname>... what an interesting name! Do you think it suits?
<Hash=0x6B50418>	Oooh or a free-spirit who can squeeze in and out of even the tightest spots imaginable.
<Hash=0xBB50BF7>	Is that really true?
<Hash=0x1B4FC39>	<gasp>	That's true! Wait... Neighthan you said balance.
<Hash=0xE93DFD25>	Well, we'll all be crazy busy writing the comic book, so we need to get someone who isn't a comic book club member to help us out.
<Hash=0xE2A21C81>	That might be just a bit overboard. I like Neighthan's suggestion of a book signing. We can autograph people's copies!
<Hash=0xBF2B0C1C>	Who or what on earth is Zam?
<Hash=0x1DC81460>	What's that? Deuce is in trouble? Well of course I'll help him out. I owe him that wish after all. Leave me to it, and I'll scare up a quick fix.
<Hash=0x9FA196A8>	I got asked to grant a wish today. Someone wanted to know what it's like to be a normie.
<Hash=0xE46012DB>	OK, we should keep an eye out for her. <name>, if you find Howleen then please ask about the sand.
<Hash=0xE9601ABA>	Well... I can change back right?
<Hash=0xDB6004B0>	Alright, let's try it out.
<Hash=0x55678083>	I feel... normal? Well... I guess that answers that question! OK, haha. Change me back!
<Hash=0xA1A199CE>	I can't... It's one of the few wishes that will never work. Maybe it's because I can't do it, it makes ME wonder what it's like to be a normie.
<Hash=0xA3A19CF4>	Wow, really? That sounds great! Do you think I could get some sand from you Twyla?
<Hash=0x97A18A10>	Oh no! Let's think... who would have taken it?
<Hash=0x7DB7920>	Ah, <name>. Thank you for coming to see me. It's about Manny, he's still running around and telling those jokes. I thought you talked to him.
<Hash=0x9DB7C46>	I'm just worried that he's going to say it to someone and really hurt their feelings. We're not all as robust as Manny Taur.
<Hash=0xBDB7F6C>	<name>	did... but obviously that didn't work.
<Hash=0xDDB8292>	Uh oh! Um, we should keep an eye on her! When she gets like this... well, let's just say I feel sorry for Manny.
<Hash=0x7A8ED198>	... heh... very funny Manny.
<Hash=0x808EDB0A>	<sigh>... Manny doesn't get it. The joke isn't funny if it's at someone's expense. I don't think it's right to walk around telling jokes about normies. I mean, how would he feel if we made jokes about him?
<Hash=0xEFE5E0B4>	Oh that'd just make him mad. I like Manny as a friend, so I don't want him to be mad at me.
<Hash=0xF2E5E56D>	Actually that's a great idea! If you tell him, then maybe he'll listen.
<Hash=0xF46C08D7>	What is THAT!?
<Hash=0xFFEE5973>	Wild berry and clover smoothies.
<Hash=0x219633E2>	There you are! Oh, and thank ghoulness you brought the plant food. Wait a minute, there's only enough here for one.
<Hash=0x1B962A70>	Well I'm not going to just sit around like a potted plant.
<Hash=0x69846B5F>	Thanks, <name>! I'm thrilled to get to show you what I'm made of!
<Hash=0xA1716EBF>	I'm sure it'll grow on you, but mine is bound to thrill from the start!
<Hash=0x9C7166E0>	With my speed, I'm sure to get there quickly.
<Hash=0xAA717CEA>	Alright, Iris... I'll even give you a head start.
<Hash=0xE229CF98>	UHHH-mazing! Thank you! Oh, and please don't tell anyone I asked you to do this.
<Hash=0x641C65E1>	It's freaky-fab, right?
<Hash=0x3D19E9E5>	I wish my seedlings had a little more opportunity for growth.
<Hash=0x3926AF8C>	Hm, that gives me an idea. <name>, can I talk to you for a sec?
<Hash=0x55249D09>	I've heard that Mr. Hackington can make potions that do all kinds of things. Could you ask him if there's something he could make for my plant?
<Hash=0x61292D1B>	Clawsome, you're the beast!
<Hash=0x5E6559DE>	Um, how gentle exactly? And shouldn't we tell someone about this.
<Hash=0x5C6556B8>	<name>... Could you go after her? Make sure she's not doing anything crazy?
<Hash=0xFA6ACCA0>	Well, uh... heh, what do you mean Jane? Unnatural? You're being silly... heh.
<Hash=0x236D4BC2>	Magnificent!?! That thing looks like it could swallow a ghost pirate ship whole!
<Hash=0x24977F3F>	Hey Ghoul, what happened to Venus?
<Hash=0x209778F3>	And she used her power on Rochelle? Oh, fear. We're going to have to talk to Venus about this.
<Hash=0xF9EAC583>	I dunno, Venus... She makes a good point.
<Hash=0x3EAD541>	She's got that wild look in her eye. <name>, please follow her and make sure she doesn't wilt on the vine?
<Hash=0xF6D48551>	<name>, you're here! Let's get started. Venus, we need to talk.
<Hash=0xF18DF7B3>	You NEED to fix this.
<Hash=0xF28DF946>	Iris is right. Venus, you just made a mistake. It's not a big deal, just go in there and talk to them. You know the monsters at this school always appreciate honesty.
<Hash=0x8686937D>	As for this plant... it looks to be somewhat docile. I'd say it's pretty harmless.
<Hash=0x78867D73>	Yeah, it can stay.
<Hash=0xF8D48877>	That doesn't matter! You can't use your pollen on other monsters!
<Hash=0xF9442AD5>	Hm? The ghouls want my help with their plants, do they? Well I just happen to know a great growth formula. But I'm short on Eye of Newt. Bring me some and I'll make the potion.
<Hash=0xF8442942>	Ah, there you are. I finished with the rest of it. Just need the Eye of Newt.
<Hash=0xF74427AF>	There we are! One growth formula. That bottle should be good for about 20-30 plants. Don't overdo it now.
<Hash=0xFE381108>	Oh, that is so scary-cool!
<Hash=0xDD587634>	We're building a robot!
<Hash=0x6BBE86B8>	Woo! Look at those arms go!
<Hash=0xB447615>	Could these arms shoot a casketball?
<Hash=0xAF0EA965>	There you are. Did you find the power cells?
<Hash=0x16B5DCB>	Can we get the robot working without power cells?
<Hash=0x3203A39E>	Hey, <name>	got the memory chips!
<Hash=0x2A039706>	Oh, so it needs to learn everything from scratch?
<Hash=0xA7F20574>	Give it some sweet threads and a name!
<Hash=0xB65739CC>	<robotname>	is on fire!
<Hash=0x434FC8FE>	Well why don't you try it out <robotname>?
<Hash=0xCB52DDAD>	Free to be. You can do whatever you want.
<Hash=0xC852D8F4>	Well, let's not forget that it wouldn't have happened without <name>.
<Hash=0x27A2869>	<name>	is <name>. It's her name.
<Hash=0xB0C64989>	Me too. First time you told the joke, I couldn't believe it was you that was saying it.
<Hash=0x75953DD>	That was Clawsome Elissabat! Purpose and Unlife are important to me too!
<Hash=0x4594F24>	Well done, Elissabat! Little shaky, but we enjoyed it.
<Hash=0x55950B7>	I've never thought so much about breakfast before. Now I'm hungry.
<Hash=0xD76658AF>	HEEEEEEEY, <name>! What brings you to my party?
<Hash=0xD666571C>	They want to use Slomix on the runway? That's the second time I've heard that this week! They're welcome to use the song, but it's not free of charge. I'll need front row seats to the fashion show. I said the same thing to Scorchio, and guess where I'm going to be this Friday night!
<Hash=0x73F960C2>	Boogey what? Oh, that funny sand that Twyla keeps in her locker! Yeah, it's right here!
<Hash=0x37C27884>	Well HEEEEEEEYYYY <name>! What can I do for ya?
<Hash=0x35C2755E>	And you think Sloman could be the new sound I'm lookin' for? Well AALLLLLLRIGHT! I've gotta check this out! Thanks for the heads up.
<Hash=0x34C273CB>	Hey there you are <name>. What's UUUUUUPPPPP!? OK so I got a sample sound from Sloman and wrote this song up last night. I'm calling it Slomix. I'm gonna give you a sneak preview, because you put me on to Sloman. Have a listen.
<Hash=0x33C27238>	So what did you think?
<Hash=0xC8157209>	YYEAAAAAHHHH! Alright! I'm going to release this bad boy today. I can't wait to see the reaction to this!
<Hash=0xC5156D50>	Huh!? You don't know what you're talking about. I'm releasing this song today, and then we'll see how people feel about it!
<Hash=0xF5AC38D1>	Excuse me, <name>. Could you get the plant food from the Biteology Room so this whole mess stops creating such a stink?
<Hash=0x6218ACFE>	Thanks!
<Hash=0x6118AB6B>	Oh, I understand. But, please come back later. We'd love to see you in your element!
<Hash=0x7E09CE88>	Fangtastic. I can't wait to show you my bootiful creations. Thanks <name>!
<Hash=0x63B9EC4E>	It's just a seedling now, but I'll bet it's going to be bootiful once it's fully-grown.
<Hash=0x66B9F107>	Good thing I know exactly where to find some.
<Hash=0x5AB9DE23>	I'm all about keeping your eye on the prize, but I don't think a race is a good idea. You're all steamed up, and that's how accidents happen.
<Hash=0x8CDCF2FB>	Awesome you got it! Thank you so much. Please don't tell anyone I asked you for this.
<Hash=0xA940C052>	My garden would have blossomed bootifully if I had just had that plant food.
<Hash=0xC03EA5F0>	Your plant is just as lovely, Gilda... even if it has a bit more growing to do.
<Hash=0xB33A144B>	Hm, that gives me an idea. <name>, can I talk to you for a sec?
<Hash=0xD13671EE>	Hey, look I've heard that Mr. Hackington can brew a potion that can help plants grow really quickly. Could you ask him to make me one?
<Hash=0xC131DB90>	Thanks, ghoul! Come back when you're done.
<Hash=0xB868FD45>	It's just... so big!
<Hash=0xB168F240>	What type of plant is it?
<Hash=0xBF69084A>	Wait... did you say Carnivorous?
<Hash=0xF7AD829B>	What's that?
<Hash=0xF2AD7ABC>	Yeah, but let's do it tomorrow when we're all together. <name>, you should come too. You are the witness after all.
<Hash=0xB9333E59>	But, sweetie couldn't the plant harm someone?
<Hash=0x7E50CDCF>	You could march in there, look them in the eye and tell them exactly what happened.
<Hash=0x38BB9B8D>	Well, we found out about your chat with Rochelle.
<Hash=0x2EBB8BCF>	You could get Rochelle into a lot of trouble with the Newspaper Club.
<Hash=0xFDB67555>	<sob>... It's not fair, I don't even know who... <incoherent sobbing>... And he doesn't even... <incoherent sobbing>
<Hash=0xFBB6722F>	<sob>... yeah, I'm ok...
<Hash=0xF9B66F09>	Ther.... there is?... <sob>... How?
<Hash=0xF7B66BE3>	Well, I don't know... that might be a bad idea. <name>, what do you think?
<Hash=0x8A4DEF64>	Alright... I'll do it. Meowlody, let's go.
<Hash=0x4B6805A>	So what does it say Meowlody!?
<Hash=0x2E6F9FDA>	It looks like a note... and it smells nice! Let me read that!
<Hash=0x1B8BA38>	Oooh no!! Not Catty! She's so talented, and purrfect. How am I supposed to compete with... <incoherent sobbing>.
<Hash=0x7B8C3AA>	You're right! Let's find him.
<Hash=0x8B8C53D>	So you swear to me that you and Catty aren't a thing?
<Hash=0x6B8C217>	I saw the note in your locker... with my own eye!
<Hash=0xFBB8B0C6>	Catty, how could you? Manny is my boofriend!
<Hash=0x9BB0567>	Don't play dumb with me! I know it was you that put the note in Manny's locker! You stay away!
<Hash=0xBBB088D>	But we did the test, and it was a werecat!
<Hash=0x5BAFF1B>	Meowlody and I did.... <gasp>	Meowlody! It was her all along!
<Hash=0x4BAFD88>	YOU!!!
<Hash=0x6BB00AE>	It's not funny! Why are you laughing!
<Hash=0xBAF73C>	I think about you like that! No one else is allowed to.
<Hash=0x286F9668>	"Dear Darling Manny"... Manny, what is this?
<Hash=0xA9AE1B>	Maybe you're right. I should leave Meowlody alone. Sorry for doubting you, Manny. I didn't mean to.
<Hash=0x2A6F998E>	"Everytime I catch your gaze..." Manny no!
<Hash=0x246F901C>	Because you're getting <sobbing>... letters from... <sobbing>
<Hash=0x10BF204E>	Hopefully this is just a phase. He's usually really nice, but these jokes are just rude.
<Hash=0xB6D53C05>	I don't really find it all that funny. Also, please don't ask me that because I'm half-normie. There are a lot of ways to be a normie, and not all of them are going to find it funny.
<Hash=0x240BCAA0>	Maybe she's here to save the day!
<Hash=0xF1D54FC8>	The plant food is in the Biteology Room.
<Hash=0xFEAE6CCB>	Look at the size of it!
<Hash=0x85261909>	Something about this... Well, it doesn't look natural.
<Hash=0x8A2620E8>	That sounds rather unfriendly. Should we be afraid of being eaten?
<Hash=0xC648F55>	Some plant monsters have the ability to control the minds of others using pollen.
<Hash=0x2AC160FA>	I would certainly agree with that.
<Hash=0x44115CB2>	And did you learn your lesson?
<Hash=0x2E9A6FD2>	<name>	saw you using your pollen on Rochelle. We know everything, ghoul.
<Hash=0x7B5718C6>	I am so fired up! The Cooking Club said they'd make our treats, but they haven't even started. You're friends with them... can you please help me out?
<Hash=0xE6BFD65D>	On my honor, it is the hottest color this season and will be the talking point of the Fashion Show!
<Hash=0xA7FE85B8>	I cannot believe I have failed.
<Hash=0xA9FE88DE>	Alright, there's certainly honor in that challenge.
<Hash=0x1CF6EF22>	I am honored for this chance.
<Hash=0xE2BFD011>	I am not sure there is much harmony in your color palettes, Skelita.
<Hash=0xE0BFCCEB>	My intention is not to sting, but only to breathe fire into the perfect show.
<Hash=0xDEBFC9C5>	I think it may be getting a little too hot in here...
<Hash=0x12ABD318>	Thank you so much for coming, <name>. We need your keen eye for such a task.
<Hash=0x8F7D6CB1>	I boolieve it is now my turn, if you don't mind, ghouls.
<Hash=0x907D6E44>	Such breathtaking beauty!
<Hash=0x847D5B60>	Are you sure? Is there nothing you like about my work?
<Hash=0xFE84D733>	P... Personal? I am sorry ghouls, but I need time to think about all of this.
<Hash=0x6FD35CF3>	... please leave me be.
<Hash=0xCCBB06F9>	.....
<Hash=0xCABB03D3>	That song really fires me up... and not in a good way.
<Hash=0xD0BB0D45>	No... Why would I... Oh... I understand. It's not me that you did not like... It was just the dress.
<Hash=0xCEBB0A1F>	Ghouls, I am so sorry to have wasted so much time on this.
<Hash=0xD4BB1391>	I know that now.
<Hash=0x70D35E86>	Wait... You never said what you think of my dress.
<Hash=0x52BE1882>	And we should get back to it as we do not have much time! The fashion show is just days away!
<Hash=0x53BE1A15>	I am so thankful to my understanding ghoulfriends for all that they have taught me today.
<Hash=0x8FC2F5B7>	You do? Well then why were the other ghouls so displeased?
<Hash=0x90C2F74A>	It is just as I thought. Everyone is displeased.
<Hash=0x9BC785C9>	I wish these ghouls could understand my vision!
<Hash=0x98C78110>	What's that supposed to mean?
<Hash=0x76D367F8>	.....
<Hash=0x2421BB21>	Freaky-fierce idea, <name>!
<Hash=0xB13D0D74>	That is too bad.
<Hash=0xF40DE7D9>	You're the beast, <name>.
<Hash=0xF10DE320>	OK, maybe you could help us out another time.
<Hash=0xAC3D0595>	Thanks for this. I know you have to call in your favor with Deuce, but it'll be worth it!
<Hash=0xBD39F37B>	Let's heat things up, ghouls, today is going to be wild!
<Hash=0xC039F834>	What about a table of scary-sweet treats?
<Hash=0x83E3DD7A>	Once everyone tells <name>	where they were at lunch, we can move on to fixing the fashion show.
<Hash=0x76E3C903>	Skelita and I were in the Foyer the entire time. Go ahead and ask. She will tell you.
<Hash=0x97237C30>	Skelita... What is wrong?
<Hash=0x58AF966A>	Please believe me. I was not involved.
<Hash=0x73DF471C>	These things happen sometimes. It's important to move forward though, and not get caught up in the blame game.
<Hash=0x9D2385A2>	Me? No! I could never do such a horrific thing.
<Hash=0x9C23840F>	I wish I knew. Skelita, what can I do to help?
<Hash=0x4D65B974>	Holt can have his front row seats, but he should be warned... this show will be scorching hot!
<Hash=0xEA8A1C2A>	I'm just not the biggest fan.
<Hash=0xE18A0DFF>	It still sort of rubs me the wrong way... But you're right, we should use Slomix.
<Hash=0xA2664697>	It's all we have left. <name>, please ask the Robot to help.
<Hash=0x9B663B92>	It sure did. Your mom would be proud.
<Hash=0xC6B0DAF2>	OK, so we forgot one minor detail...
<Hash=0x8B6860F9>	Thanks Skelita, I got all of my inspiration from you. It's easy to confuse feedback with criticism. Although, I think we all owe <name>	a huge thank you.
<Hash=0x8F686745>	I think I'm going to take a break from the stress of Fashion Club and relax for a bit. Perhaps start a Zen garden in Environmental Club.
<Hash=0xE402F711>	Agreed! So, everyone, we need intel. Do your best not to get caught and listen out for any clues about the cursed plan.
<Hash=0xE702FBCA>	Good, we'll spend the rest of the day gathering intel on the cursed and Spookenkhamun's master plan... Well, I guess that's it for now. Be careful! Tomorrow, we'll meet back here at the Library, same time, and we'll use the info collected to create the best plan possible...
<Hash=0xE502F8A4>	So, I was thinking we should try to infiltrate tomorrow's Council meeting, to see if the cursed members will open up and let something important slip.
<Hash=0x4C940C85>	Cool! OK, meet me near the back entrance to Ectonomics tomorrow morning and we'll sneak in.
<Hash=0x499407CC>	That's true, but you know what... doing nothing is a bigger risk. Come on, meet me outside Ectonomics. We'll be in and out in no time.
<Hash=0xF0C824ED>	If we're gonna do something like that, our timing has to be just right, so we catch 'Spook 'Em' off guard. We'd need the element of surprise!!!
<Hash=0x6FDD9553>	You made it! I was starting to worry that I'd have to be in here by myself! Come on, hide quickly, here they come!
<Hash=0x76CFE2D0>	I can't believe it! Now there's no doubt that the curse is real and Spookenkhamun is trying to take control of Monster High. The rally at lunch will be the perfect time to find out exactly what he's planning! Whaddya think?
<Hash=0x78CFE5F6>	Do you have any better ideas? Didn't think so... The fact is, this is the only move we have left! At least they won't be expecting us to do something as crazy as infiltrating a room jam-packed with cursed students!
<Hash=0x79CFE789>	OK. So at lunch we inflitrate the Cursed Rally, and find out Spookenkhamun's master plan. It'll be a piece of cake... I mean, what could possibly go wrong?
<Hash=0x7ACFE91C>	That rally is our best chance at finding out the cursed plan! We need to know so we can take care of this curse once and for all!
<Hash=0x40772E05>	Alright, we're all set to go. While we're in there, we should take up different positions. That way if they catch one of us, the other will be OK.
<Hash=0xB09DBD6F>	OK, I'll go in now. You should wait a minute and then follow me in. We don't want to arouse suspicion. We'll meet back at the Library afterward.
<Hash=0x419652ED>	Hey, there you are. I just told everyone what happened. Did you have any troubles getting out of the Clawditorium?
<Hash=0x3B96497B>	OH NOOOOO!!! She's been cursed!!
<Hash=0x3C964B0E>	GHOUL!!! THAT'S NOT FUNNY!!!
<Hash=0x3E772ADF>	Are you ready?
<Hash=0x3E988CCB>	Look, why don't we just kick this Spook'em's you-know-what'em?! I can't even talk reason to Cleo anymore, she's a completely different monster!

The same with all the cursed students. It's light's on, nobody's home! We've really gotta stop this crazy Pharaoh and save our friends!
<Hash=0x3D988B38>	We can do this!!! We've gotta save the school 'coz no one else will!
<Hash=0x3C7727B9>	OK, well take your time and let me know when you are.
<Hash=0x63506DAA>	So everyone, it looks like we all came up with more than a few ideas that may help us out of this sticky sitch. Anyone want to get the ball rolling? Sure Deuce, go ahead...
<Hash=0xF29C8B01>	Hm, considering Cleo is at the middle of all this, maybe we just need to distract her long enough to get that amulet out of her hands!
<Hash=0xF49C8E27>	Awesome stuff, I'll join too... always wanted to give Fearleading a crack! Guess, this is my chance. You know what? I think this is actually gonna work!

We'll need a second team to stick close to Cleo, and grab that amulet when she's distracted.
<Hash=0xEA9C7E69>	Then let's get to it! There's not much time and tons of preparation...

Fearleaders, we need to talk. We're gonna need practice. Lot's of it! But we can't use the gym at LUNCH, because Cleo and her Cursed Team will be there. The only option is to train at MORNING and AFTERNOON!
<Hash=0xEA9A3FD2>	No time, like the present ghouls! Let's meet at the Casketball Court. I'll meet you guys there!
<Hash=0xE79A3B19>	Finally, a chance to try out fearleading! It's fun too! Too bad it actually took a curse to make me do it...
<Hash=0x61506A84>	That'll work nicely, anyone else got something to add? Frankie?
<Hash=0x5F50675E>	That sounds really promising, Frankie. Thanks! Does anyone else have any ideas on how to reverse Spookenkhamun's curse?
<Hash=0x5E5065CB>	Look at this point, even the craziest of ideas count! Anyone?! Yeah, Catty let's hear it!
<Hash=0xC80AF01F>	Hey, we've just hit a bit of a snag. Frankie just reminded us that to enter the Fearleading Nationals, we need to pay the $500 entrance fee!
<Hash=0x183819FD>	No time for doubt! Now it's do or die!!!
<Hash=0xF380BD2>	You really do have school spirit Ghoul! While you infiltrate the Council to snatch the cash, we'll keep practicing harder than ever. Meet us back here once you're done...
<Hash=0xFE3A2FA6>	New Ghoul! You're back already, and you brought the cash!
<Hash=0xFF3A3139>	Awesome! This is exactly what we need. Catty, take this money and fill in the Entry Form for the Fearleading Monster Nationals. Then stick both of them in an envelope and send it ASAP!!!
<Hash=0xFD3A2E13>	Well, there's nothing more we can do, other than practice. So let's give the routine another run through and we'll call it a day...
<Hash=0x23A35F2>	How'd it go, Catty?
<Hash=0x3A32CC>	Excellent! Good work everyone, let's call it a day! We only have tomorrow to practice, then we perform live at the Monster Nationals. Get some rest, you're gonna need it!
<Hash=0x63A3C3E>	Things are really coming together! We can do this!!!
<Hash=0xCA0AF345>	Anyone have any bright ideas?
<Hash=0xC40AE9D3>	Oh my! Why, didn't I think of that before?! The extra funds that the Council raised. They were gonna use it for a hot tub, but with everything that's been happening it hasn't been built yet. That means the money is somewhere in Ectonomics! All we have to do is go and get it...
<Hash=0x4E2DE1A3>	Now you're just being silly. Wait, I have a great idea. The Council got some extra funds that they haven't spent yet! We could sneak into Ectonomics and get it before the cursed students realize!
<Hash=0xC60AECF9>	The New Ghoul and I were both on the council, and know where the money is. But, I need to keep practicing this routine!
<Hash=0xCF0AFB24>	New Ghoul, can you go and get the money from Ectonomics?
<Hash=0xEAE42FC4>	This is it ghouls! The day of the Monster Nationals and our last chance to train. Let's make this practice a good one. We all know what we have to do.
<Hash=0xEDE4347D>	Great work mates!!! With moves like these, I think we might have a shot at defeating Cleo and her cursed fearleaders at their own game...
<Hash=0xE7E42B0B>	I wouldn't say it, if I didn't!
<Hash=0xE9E42E31>	Well we're past the point of no return now. We know the routine back to front, now all we can do is perform it with every ounce of school spirit we can muster.

Before we break though, I'd just like to say, that no matter what happens tonight, I'm so proud of you all!
<Hash=0xE3E424BF>	Take your time enjoying lunch. You're all gonna need every ounce of strength after school when we compete in the Monster Nationals. Good luck, I'll see you all at the competition!
<Hash=0xF1F46E6E>	Let's do it ghouls! 1, 2, 3... GO!!!
<Hash=0x7001AFF7>	Hey, I'm glad you came! Come on over and I'll introduce you to the rest of the Student Council...
<Hash=0x19A7B645>	(surprise) Wow! Thanks Toralei. That's a huge responsibility.
<Hash=0x7101B18A>	Don't be shy! The members of the Student Council don't bite... much. (laughs)... Anyhoo, you've already met me, and here's the rest of the team...
<Hash=0xF4AD8C34>	So, this is Abbey. She's the Council's Treasurer.
<Hash=0xEC9C367B>	This is Spectra, the Gory Gazette blogger herself. But, of course, you've already met.
<Hash=0xD09E48FE>	This is Catrine. She's originally from Scaris, France. Trust me, once you get to know her, she's a real scream!!!
<Hash=0xF8A0C68D>	Now, this rockin' werecat is our fearless leader Toralei, the President of the Student Council.
<Hash=0xF6A0C367>	(whispered) Look, to be honest, Toralei can be a bit of a mean-ghoul at times, but don't totally believe her rep. Underneath that catty exterior, is a soft spot for ghouls in need.
<Hash=0x6E01ACD1>	Well, that's it for the intros. As you can see, we've got a pretty diverse group here and I'm sure you'll fit right in. Hey Toralei, wanna get this Council meeting rolling? We haven't got all day...
<Hash=0x13E5BEA>	OK everyone, maybe we should all get some rest! It's been a hectic week and we've all earned some down time. On Toralei's behalf, this meeting is adjourned. We'll catch up with everything tomorrow, hopefully Toralei will be feeling better then...
<Hash=0x23E5D7D>	Gee, I hope everything's alright with Toralei. She really didn't sound good!
<Hash=0xFDD2DA32>	Abbey's right Toralei. Taking that money is what's called corruption. It's just like stealing. Don't forget, we weren't the only ones involved in making the Bake Sale a success. The Cooking Club spent heaps time baking the cookies and the students gave us their support by buying them. It's their money, as much as ours!
<Hash=0xFCD2D89F>	Toralei, please don't do this! We've only just earned the students' trust by making those improvements to the school. If anyone found out, it would spell doom for the Student Council!
<Hash=0xFAD2D579>	Toralei, the Council is a democracy. We should all have a say. At the very least, put it to a vote!!!
<Hash=0xF8D2D253>	TOORRAALLEEIII?!!
<Hash=0xA92D1567>	(whispered) I've got a bad feeling about this...
<Hash=0xA8F897F5>	WHAAATT?!!!
<Hash=0xA3F89016>	Come on ghoul-friend, let's go! We'll get to the bottom of this, you'll see!
<Hash=0xA2F88E83>	What just happened?!
<Hash=0x836B9F84>	It sure is! I've got ghostbumps, on my ghostbumps!!!
<Hash=0x866BA43D>	Totally! Any minute I'm expecting the guys in the white suits to appear and chase the students with a huge net!!!
<Hash=0xAFF8A2FA>	How about we meet up tomorrow at the Pool? Until then, be very careful and stay safe...
<Hash=0xA42D0D88>	Oh no! Not you too, Abbey...
<Hash=0xA62D10AE>	I can't believe what I'm seeing...
<Hash=0x2CA4BCEC>	Yesterday was a total nightmare, dontcha think? It was like everyone lost their minds... Or some monster TOOK OVER everyone's minds!
<Hash=0x23554E54>	That's totally bonkers!!! Next you'll be telling me there's a killer Mummy on the rampage... Ummm, there isn't, is there? Ugh... this is doin' my head in! Do you really think it's all true?!
<Hash=0x2555517A>	Noticed Cleo lately?
<Hash=0x1F554808>	She's at the centre it all!
<Hash=0x21554B2E>	Not to mention, she never goes anywhere without that amulet anymore and crazy seems to follow her. It's like she's obsessed with the thing!
<Hash=0x1B5541BC>	Nooo... Why do you say that?
<Hash=0x955CBD8F>	I wouldn't worry about it Catty. It's more likely to be something connected to Cleo and her amulet.
<Hash=0x975CC0B5>	So, what's our next move?
<Hash=0xF6F44A86>	That's a great idea, the more allies we have, the safer we'll be. Safety in numbers and all that. We should all head out and find at least 2 un-cursed students each, people we can really trust. Then we should get everyone to meet at the Library, so that we can work out our next move.
<Hash=0xF5F448F3>	Goulia is getting into the research at the moment. Maybe she'll find something that can help us out.
<Hash=0x925CB8D6>	Oh my, ghoul... that's really bad! It's too late for the Headmistress. Her only hope and that of Monster High, is for us to find any un-cursed students that can band together to fight back!
<Hash=0x9C5CC894>	Gotta find un-cused allies if we hope to save the school!
<Hash=0x29A4B833>	Yeah, it's like the whole Council are completely different people now! And what's with all that kooky Egyptian stuff, they keep babbling about?
<Hash=0x2BA4BB59>	There's an Egyptian Curse at Monster High. How do you know this?
<Hash=0x35A4CB17>	So Ghoulia's researching this thing called the Curse of Spookenkhamun?!
<Hash=0xE77FB123>	Don't you think the Students would have a problem with that?
<Hash=0xEA7FB5DC>	What about a Bake Sale? Students love cookies, so we'd be sure to sell tons of 'em!
<Hash=0x42B18748>	Well, after talking to the Council Members and compiling their notes, it seems that it was a ghoulish success!
<Hash=0x7778450E>	Great! It turns out that Posting Flyers is still one of the best ways to get the word out and capture Student attention. My recommendation would be that the Council Post Flyers to build Student awareness about the Bake Sale.
<Hash=0x79784834>	Already done! I spoke to Lorna at the Student Newspaper, who was happy to help out. She got her designers to make up the flyer, while Headmistress Bloodgood allowed me to use the photocopy facilities in the Office. She even gave me a bunch of spooky-tape from the store room...
<Hash=0x7C784CED>	Everything seems to be going well and Toralei hasn't had a hissy-fit yet... It's almost too good to be true.
<Hash=0x46B18D94>	Sure did! I even put them in order of priority. The big Student issues that need to be resolved by the Council are:

1 - Nearly everyone wanted a big screen TV in the Creepateria so they could watch Ever After High while eating.

2 - The Creepateria Chairs are all grunged up and fiendishly uncomforable.

3 - Most of the Vending Machines at Monster High don't work and the one's that do need to be re-stocked.

4 - The Casketball Scoreboard doesn't work properly and might even pose a danger to the Students.

5 - The Casketball Court is rundown and needs a total overhall. New rings, nets, backboards, lines...
<Hash=0x9F9BDE36>	OK, let's get to it ghouls!
<Hash=0x1B24351E>	Listen up, everyone! This is how it's gonna go down. We calculated the highest student traffic areas in the school and each of you has been assigned an area. The name of the game is to sell as many cookies as possible. Any questions? Yes, Spectra.
<Hash=0x1D243844>	No Spectra! The cookies aren't for us. We're selling them to raise funds so we can fix things around Monster High. Remember? Now stop messing about and let me go over everyone's positions...
<Hash=0x1F243B6A>	OK! So to make things easier I've uploaded each of your fundraising locations to your iCoffin MAPPs. Just follow the glowing icon to your designated area and you'll find everything that you'll need to sell cookies. Any questions?
<Hash=0x2BD49A73>	They're already done! I figured that since the first Fundraiser was such a big success, I'd hop onto designing the flyers for the next one. Since we had a prioritized list of projects, I already knew it would be for a Casketball Court re-vamp.
<Hash=0xECD40ADC>	Sure do! While it's still early days, initial buzz around Monster High is that the Student Council are all legends. The students are lovin' the new Creepateria, especially the TV so they can watch while they eat. Support for the Council has never been higher!
<Hash=0xEAD407B6>	That would be the Casketball Scoreboard. Apparently, it's in bad shape and possibly bordering on the dangerous! In fact, the whole Casketball Court could use a make-over. It's actually embarrassing when schools visit for Home games!
<Hash=0x9DDEE6CD>	Walking through the corridors this morning, it's obvious that people are really excited! The students I spoke to love the idea of eating cookies and at the same time improving Monster High. It's a win, win situation, for all of us!!!
<Hash=0x7867D342>	Listen up, people! Looking at the student movements from the last fundraiser, we've improved the positioning of the Cookie re-stocking points. Once again each of you has been assigned a specific area. You know the deal. Sell as many cookies as is monsterly possible. Any questions? Yes, Catrine.
<Hash=0x7367CB63>	You've gotta be joking ghouls!!! NO!!! That's enough! No one's getting any cookies. They're strictly for the sale so we can raise money to fix-up the Casketball Court. Remember?! Now stop being silly and let's get on with it!
<Hash=0x7E67DCB4>	Once again, I've uploaded each of your selling locations to your iCoffin MAPPs. Find your way to the glowing icon and you'll be in position.
<Hash=0xE5638546>	It's Clawsome to meet you! I just love chatting about the work we do on the Council. Joining the Student Council is one of the few ways that you can really make a difference at Monster High. I know I'm a bit biased, but I think you'd make a great member of the team. It looks like you've got a good head on your shoulders and you'd be doing something that could really change the school for the better.

If you wanna leave your mark on Monster High and help the students while doing so, there's no better way than the Student Council. Who knows, with a bit of hard work, you could even become Student Disembodied President. So whaddya say, you want to sign up?
<Hash=0xE3638220>	That's totally clawsome! I see big things for you in the future. Together, we'll help make Monster High a better place for all of the students. Congratulations, you're now officially a member of the Student Council!!!

Look, there's a meeting starting in about ten minutes. Why don't you come by and check it out for yourself. I've updated your iCoffin MAPP with the location. I've gotta jet, but I'll meet you there. See ya...
<Hash=0xFC2C3E5E>	Oh, that normie joke he keeps telling? I think it's dumb to be honest.
<Hash=0xFE2C4184>	And you asked him not to tell those jokes?
<Hash=0x2C44AA>	Gil, stand aside... Howleen's on the case.
<Hash=0xF22C2EA0>	I don't care if your cousin thinks it's funny Manny! I really don't. You just can't bring those types of jokes to school, OK? Some people get really offended by them!
<Hash=0x7033B0BF>	Oh, no! Poor guy got upset and ran for it... straight into the Janitor's Closet. <name>, you should go in there and see how he is. It's hard when people gang up on you like that.
<Hash=0x9C827E02>	So then the normie says... haha... 'It's not an allergy, I'm a normie!' Hahaha! Isn't that great?
<Hash=0x9C6CB6E1>	Hey, my cousin is a comedian! I think he knows what's funny. Come on guys, anyone? Back me up here... it's funny right?
<Hash=0x2A69C4D4>	Right... OK... So I'm rude and disrespectful... I see.

Excuse me...
<Hash=0x2869C1AE>	What do you want?
<Hash=0x617788CB>	Yeah... I'm fine. I just wanted to share some humor with my friends, but... I guess they didn't like it.
<Hash=0x62778A5E>	Sorry for the jokes? You're probably right. I just wanted to share some humor with my friends, but... I guess they didn't like it.
<Hash=0x2569BCF5>	But I should apologize. I realize now that they told me a few times to stop, but I kept going. I thought they just didn't get it.
<Hash=0x2469BB62>	Thanks <name>. You've helped make sense of it all.
<Hash=0x9A827ADC>	Hah, yeah that's a great one. Oh! There's Clawd, I gotta tell him this one, he's gonna love it!
<Hash=0x97827623>	So like, then the normie goes 'It's not an allergy, I'm an normie!' Hahaha!
<Hash=0x96827490>	What... you didn't like the joke? Well boo-hoo! It's not offensive to normies, it's just a joke. Jackson, you think it's a funny joke right... you know, being half normie and that?
<Hash=0xA4828A9A>	Pffft!! You guys obviously just don't get it. You know what, I'm out of here.
<Hash=0xF9390DFF>	What's this?
<Hash=0x8BD39F2C>	Yes! I swear. Where is this coming from?
<Hash=0xFB391125>	Er, OK sure...
<Hash=0x8DD5E0E9>	Meowlody left that note? Haha!
<Hash=0x97D5F0A7>	What? It's not like I would leave you for her. It's just nice to know someone thinks about me like that.
<Hash=0x85C48B30>	Oh I know you do, and I like that too. But look, I think I can resist Meowlody's charms. And, I'd really like for you to trust me.
<Hash=0xF53907B3>	I have no idea!
<Hash=0xF7390AD9>	Huh? Why are you getting upset with me?
<Hash=0x1391A97>	What just happened? Could you go in there and check on her? I would, but uh... that's the ghouls' bathroom.
<Hash=0x6C35AD2A>	A little healthy competition can be a good thing. It pushes monsters to strive for more. I just hope everyone keeps their cool.
<Hash=0x979881B6>	What was your inspiration, Skelita?
<Hash=0x9B988802>	You know, this one I am not so sure about.
<Hash=0x999AC373>	Sorry for all the drama today. We're a colorful bunch, but that's what makes us so passionate about our art.
<Hash=0x8B2E74F>	Come on, let's get this show on the road.
<Hash=0x9444239B>	Oh please, do you remember when Slomo's remix came out?
<Hash=0x964426C1>	Yes, but does that mean you dislike Slomo?
<Hash=0x9A442D0D>	We're sorry too. We never meant to hurt your feelings.
<Hash=0x64B92D6>	I had no idea Fashion Club would be so intense! I thought we'd just be talking about shoes.
<Hash=0xCDC08D24>	Fangtastic!
<Hash=0xBAB9B376>	Don't fret... I think you've got what it takes!
<Hash=0x320309B2>	What's the next item on the list?
<Hash=0x456CF0AA>	We'll help you fix it Skelita.
<Hash=0x426CEBF1>	Why <name>?
<Hash=0xD17ADD4B>	I cannot boolieve this. Such a monstrous setback.
<Hash=0x3D6AA57B>	I met up with Lorna in the south hall and we decided to visit the Study Howl.
<Hash=0xACF0C664>	... Alright... I did it.
<Hash=0x416AABC7>	It was a huge and total accident!
<Hash=0x376A9C09>	<sigh>	OK... So I came to the Clawditorium at lunch to work on designing my own dress, when I saw something move out the corner of my eye.
<Hash=0x366A9A76>	I got scared and took a couple of steps backward... But then, my feet got snagged on some fabric. I began to fall, so I reached out to grab at something.. You know, to keep me stable. And well.... That something just happened to be your dress... I'm so sorry Skelita.
<Hash=0xBA6798AB>	You're not upset with me?
<Hash=0xBC679BD1>	I'll help... I feel awful.
<Hash=0xB2678C13>	Wow, I really thought they were going to chew me up for that mistake! I'm so lucky to have such fangtastic friends.
<Hash=0xCB7AD3D9>	It could have been anyone.
<Hash=0xF0802F7A>	His music may be totally hot right now, but Holt is one cool dude. I'm sure he'd be okay if we used his song.
<Hash=0x55830D10>	Holt is on fire lately. I'm thrilld to have him as part of the show.
<Hash=0xD7912236>	Well, if the hottest fashion designer in the world wants to use the song when why shouldn't we?
<Hash=0x48EF2F46>	Oh wow, you guys that was freaky-fierce!
<Hash=0xD9F6CF4E>	Well that was freaky-fab! I can't wait for the next one.
<Hash=0xFB08329B>	I'd help out, but these feet in those shoes? Not happening.
<Hash=0x6671193A>	You know... I'm just not sure that it is.
<Hash=0x4D0A692B>	I can't wait to see what trouble we can scratch up next.
<Hash=0x8395AFF2>	I can't explain it but, I'm mesmerized by these colors.
<Hash=0x7D95A680>	I know what you mean, like... Where can I wear this?
<Hash=0x7B9364C3>	Seriously. It's just a fashion show.
<Hash=0x80936CA2>	Once, she melted a piece of art she was working on.
<Hash=0xC4D5D795>	Flattery always gets a werecat everywhere.
<Hash=0xC8D5DDE1>	I have a feeling our new ghoulfriend here would make the purrrfect model.
<Hash=0xC5E5D10C>	Maybe all it needs is some yarn...
<Hash=0x55DE64F7>	Seriously though, I'm getting cat scratch fever thanks to this debate debacle. Can we please move on?
<Hash=0xB4FCB5D9>	What... you're not talking to us?
<Hash=0x1584E240>	Finally, <name>, what took you so long?
<Hash=0x513077E3>	Rumor has it the kitchen is a mess these days.
<Hash=0x63374FFE>	Don't play too many cat and mouse games. We don't have that much time.
<Hash=0x1784E566>	There are still a lot of details we need to scratch out.
<Hash=0x1984E88C>	Has anyone thought about how we'll seat the audience.
<Hash=0xBB63876B>	How do you suggest we go about doing that?
<Hash=0x43669C1A>	Let's see, I pried open my locker to put my books away. Then Purrsephone and I went to the level 2 hallway to meet up with Toralei.
<Hash=0x797D9C31>	It sounds like something I might do... but not this time.
<Hash=0x2F6AF9CC>	Time to move on from this cat-astrophe.
<Hash=0x966F71DA>	Is it possible the monster responsible is in this room?
<Hash=0x9F7BC2A>	I'm telling you... It's the right music to play!
<Hash=0xC9FD1B5B>	Think you can handle another Fashion Club emergency, <name>? Ask Holt if we can use Slomix for the runway show.
<Hash=0x1780BAC4>	Hurry ghoul, we don't have much time.
<Hash=0x1A80BF7D>	Alright, come back if you find the time.
<Hash=0xC1FAD02C>	I don't know why everyone was so worried.
<Hash=0x3F7B2B8>	Exactly! This is a no-brainer.
<Hash=0x88FE4F5C>	I've never heard of a Robot model before.
<Hash=0x86FE4C36>	The snacks, the music, the model... I've gotta admit, even I had fun.
<Hash=0x1AF6E66D>	I guess we owe you a little thanks, <name>.
<Hash=0xFF6D51C>	See you next time, ghoul.
<Hash=0xE31E7639>	Chop, chop, Fashion Club. There are people waiting out there!
<Hash=0xE5DFCFEB>	Hey Iris, I just saw what happened. Are you alright?
<Hash=0xE7DFD311>	You know... there's a way we could test the note to find out which ghoul put it in Manny's locker.
<Hash=0xE9DFD637>	Just come with me to the Mad Science room and we'll run a couple of tests.
<Hash=0x563DD206>	Listen to your heart instead, Iris. You need to find out.
<Hash=0x56E73D93>	Well, we know for sure that it's a werecat, but this test is going to tell us exactly which one.
<Hash=0x55E73C00>	<gasp>... The results say that the note was left there by Catty Noir!
<Hash=0x57E73F26>	I think you should talk to Manny about this, get his side of the story.
<Hash=0x9D42CAE7>	Furrrocious! I wonder what it says about <name>'s flaws?
<Hash=0x701A3AA1>	Creeperific! I can already imagine a hero with the balance of a tight rope-walking werecat.
<Hash=0xA4A3243>	It sure does! <heroname>	is a scary-awesome name for our hero.
<Hash=0x651A2950>	Yeah I did. Hm... I guess it's probably because of my two left zombie feet! It makes perfect sense! Wow Ghoulia, you really know comic books!
<Hash=0xCAA25D96>	Whoaa! Ghoulia, that's amazing! Can we see the outfit?
<Hash=0xD0A26708>	How are we going to spread the word?
<Hash=0x9C6A61BD>	Thanks, but a book signing needs a grave amount of work too... I mean, we should get some art to hang up, and of course we need to get the word out.
<Hash=0xF1F27CD3>	I can't wait to write the sequel! <heroname>: The Return of Zam!
<Hash=0xF7F28645>	It's the <heroname>'s new villain! Zam from the portal of apocalypse! He controls which direction time flows!
<Hash=0x99BA4858>	Looking at the evidence the New Ghoul was pretty sure that Spectra was the one who triggered the fire alarm. But what was with the memory loss? Did she hit her head?
<Hash=0x456B7FC>	Great idea!
<Hash=0x756BCB5>	That's risky!
<Hash=0x832C2E3A>	Yeah!
<Hash=0x822C2CA7>	No way!
<Hash=0x70F8FCC7>	No trouble.
<Hash=0x71F8FE5A>	One of us...
<Hash=0x9738A8A9>	Yep!
<Hash=0x9438A3F0>	Nope
<Hash=0x32AD7A52>	Sure!
<Hash=0x31AD78BF>	No way!
<Hash=0xE88690FF>	Council Money
<Hash=0xE9869292>	Sell our iCoffins?
<Hash=0x807ACDDD>	You got it, ghoul!
<Hash=0x7D7AC924>	I'm busy.
<Hash=0x9EB55BD4>	Comic Book Club
<Hash=0x9883EE01>	Couldn't you learn?
<Hash=0x9583E948>	Ghoulia?
<Hash=0x9FF5CB4F>	Super Speed
<Hash=0xA0F5CCE2>	Super Intelligent
<Hash=0xABFA5B61>	Wits!
<Hash=0xA8FA56A8>	Fists!
<Hash=0xA9FA583B>	Laser Eyes!
<Hash=0xAEFA601A>	Mind Reading!
<Hash=0x2A4A414A>	<heroname>
<Hash=0xDCC3A5AF>	Of course, ghoul!
<Hash=0xDDC3A742>	Not right now.
<Hash=0x1193E631>	Tell them!
<Hash=0xE93E178>	I gotta run.
<Hash=0xEF304287>	Smells good!
<Hash=0xF030441A>	Can I help?
<Hash=0x7BA2693F>	On it!
<Hash=0x7CA26AD2>	Maybe, next time
<Hash=0x1F2A0B9D>	Oh no!
<Hash=0x1C2A06E4>	Bummer!
<Hash=0x44BD8666>	Fashion Club Treats
<Hash=0x43BD84D3>	Nothing much.
<Hash=0x5CD3727D>	Sure!
<Hash=0x59D36DC4>	Nope.
<Hash=0xB99F836>	The Robot?
<Hash=0xA99F6A3>	How can I help?
<Hash=0xC0ED4D90>	You're welcome.
<Hash=0xC3ED5249>	It was <robotname>!
<Hash=0x361576C2>	Sweet Treats!
<Hash=0x3515752F>	I just saw Jinafire!
<Hash=0x8BA07F21>	Lagoona!
<Hash=0x88A07A68>	Someone else!
<Hash=0x6D0DA9B6>	Yes. Sign me up!
<Hash=0x734E29A4>	Call out!
<Hash=0x764E2E5D>	Stay quiet
<Hash=0xF6BE3BB8>	Hello! Anybody there?
<Hash=0xDB192FE6>	Don't raise hand
<Hash=0xDA192E53>	Raise Hand
<Hash=0xF203D87>	This is scary!
<Hash=0x10203F1A>	This is crazy!
<Hash=0x26FF3E15>	Find allies!
<Hash=0x23FF395C>	Ghoulia!
<Hash=0x9BD432B5>	She's cursed too!

<Hash=0xC86F6871>	Cooking Club?
<Hash=0xC56F63B8>	No idea!
<Hash=0xD4672C90>	Yeah, OK!
<Hash=0xD7673149>	Nah, I'm too busy!
<Hash=0x371E8A5A>	Spot on!
<Hash=0x361E88C7>	Way off!
<Hash=0x322B5AC>	Yep.
<Hash=0x622BA65>	No way!
<Hash=0x50A1B0DA>	Yeah, OK.
<Hash=0x4FA1AF47>	No way!
<Hash=0x3C3FDD42>	Sure, I'll do it!
<Hash=0x2F84F2C7>	It's great!
<Hash=0x3084F45A>	Kinda strange!
<Hash=0x1A10944E>	Nailed it.
<Hash=0x191092BB>	Not even close.
<Hash=0xB6F68681>	Double it!
<Hash=0xF399BC07>	Sure, I'm on it!
<Hash=0xD8E572E6>	That's it.
<Hash=0xD7E57153>	Yeah, right!
<Hash=0x28DBC723>	I don't think so!
<Hash=0x29DBC8B6>	Sure!
<Hash=0x47F61A68>	Maybe.
<Hash=0x4AF61F21>	Not really.
<Hash=0x8E659973>	Thanks for the help.
<Hash=0x5012A914>	OK, let's go then!
<Hash=0x5312ADCD>	I dunno
<Hash=0x9F67F2CD>	Yes. Sign me up!
<Hash=0xCB683811>	Yes, it's my first day.
<Hash=0xC8683358>	Nope.
<Hash=0x805A6CB8>	Nah, I was only kidding.
<Hash=0xF3511DBA>	Yes, please.
<Hash=0xF2511C27>	No, thanks.
<Hash=0x53B11853>	Sure thing, ghoul.
<Hash=0x54B119E6>	Sorry, I'm busy.
<Hash=0x77C05B89>	Iris!
<Hash=0x74C056D0>	Gilda!
<Hash=0xE48C5262>	Sure
<Hash=0xE38C50CF>	Not today.
<Hash=0x38B4C41A>	Pollen Persuasion!

<Hash=0xF0B57235>	Apple Green
<Hash=0xEDB56D7C>	Midnight Blue
<Hash=0x61514B39>	I like it.
<Hash=0x5E514680>	It wasn't my style.
<Hash=0x7D426CC3>	Improve it?
<Hash=0x7E426E56>	Can't be perfect
<Hash=0x9234673>	Me!
<Hash=0x5C8AFA25>	Of course!
<Hash=0x598AF56C>	Not today.
<Hash=0x4C3737A4>	Cooking Club!
<Hash=0x4F373C5D>	Not sure.
<Hash=0x85C47067>	That's all.
<Hash=0x86C471FA>	It was you!
<Hash=0x3CD93424>	I'm on it!
<Hash=0x3FD938DD>	I'd rather not today
<Hash=0xC14C1E87>	Fashion Club
<Hash=0x65724E93>	OK, I'll do it.
<Hash=0x66725026>	Robot?
<Hash=0x1DA8A5AC>	Be a model!
<Hash=0x4EB7FD59>	OK, I'll face my fear!
<Hash=0x4BB7F8A0>	I have stage fright!
<Hash=0x4F16692C>	New Captain?
<Hash=0x52166DE5>	Work harder?
<Hash=0x47051373>	Yes!
<Hash=0x48051506>	Not yet!
<Hash=0x66CB57E2>	Talk to Ghoulia!
<Hash=0x65CB564F>	I don't know
<Hash=0x642DEBDB>	Yep, ready!
<Hash=0x652DED6E>	Not ready!
<Hash=0x4B69D2B1>	Sure!
<Hash=0x4869CDF8>	I dunno.
<Hash=0x5942E785>	Sounds great!
<Hash=0x5642E2CC>	Crazy plan!
<Hash=0x39BB0684>	Lagoona and Catty!
<Hash=0x3CBB0B3D>	Meeting at the Library!
<Hash=0xA86DA389>	The Fire Alarm.
<Hash=0xA56D9ED0>	I don't know!
<Hash=0x61F57FC7>	Yes!
<Hash=0x62F5815A>	Not yet!
<Hash=0x78DFC73A>	Yes!
<Hash=0x77DFC5A7>	I don't know
<Hash=0xFC111F1>	Yes I do, but..
<Hash=0x29BE7B64>	Of course.
<Hash=0x2CBE801D>	I'll try...
<Hash=0xC7DB0569>	Yes!
<Hash=0xC4DB00B0>	Not yet!
<Hash=0xAFD1E545>	She doesn't remember.
<Hash=0xACD1E08C>	Practice without her.
<Hash=0x790F4D0A>	With Spectra
<Hash=0x780F4B77>	At the Council!
<Hash=0x62D25095>	Chatting with Spectra.
<Hash=0x911A002E>	She ran away!
<Hash=0x9019FE9B>	That was it.
<Hash=0xB7028639>	OK! Sure...
<Hash=0xB4028180>	But, I hardly know her
<Hash=0xB6F74D46>	Cleo's Amulet!
<Hash=0xB5F74BB3>	No idea!
<Hash=0x1F7E483F>	OK! You've convinced me.
<Hash=0xD9CE04C9>	Cleo's changed!
<Hash=0xD6CE0010>	The Amulet!
<Hash=0x7271FEF5>	She needs time
<Hash=0x6F71FA3C>	She's pretty upset
<Hash=0x7A9020A1>	Good idea!
<Hash=0x77901BE8>	It's pretty urgent
<Hash=0xB15A7519>	Run for it!
<Hash=0xAE5A7060>	Make an excuse!
<Hash=0xC610B935>	Things are weird!
<Hash=0xC310B47C>	Nah!
<Hash=0xF1C9CE50>	No problem!
<Hash=0xF4C9D309>	Hm, I'm busy.
<Hash=0xE4B5D0E0>	Sure do!
<Hash=0xE7B5D599>	Not really.
<Hash=0x3C322D80>	Yeah, OK.
<Hash=0x3F323239>	Sorry, not today.
<Hash=0xBFEA762E>	I guess so.
<Hash=0xBEEA749B>	I don't think so
<Hash=0x60E30495>	Sure!
<Hash=0x5DE2FFDC>	Not today
<Hash=0x10374061>	Yeah OK.
<Hash=0xD373BA8>	Not right now.
<Hash=0x8BBF1BB0>	Alright!
<Hash=0x8EBF2069>	No, thanks.
<Hash=0x4B38164A>	Sloman Sings!
<Hash=0x8C2CC405>	It's great!
<Hash=0x892CBF4C>	No good!
<Hash=0xA657F9F8>	Are you ok?
<Hash=0xA957FEB1>	Say sorry!
<Hash=0xE9B930B3>	Tell him!
<Hash=0xEAB93246>	I'll tell him!
<Hash=0x2A44E9E>	Sure!
<Hash=0x1A44D0B>	No.
<Hash=0x137E0CC0>	Friends!
<Hash=0x167E1179>	Spoons!
<Hash=0x47851A61>	Life!
<Hash=0x448515A8>	Breakfast!
<Hash=0x71AFAA1F>	Sure
<Hash=0x72AFABB2>	Sorry
<Hash=0x71A2DE2C>	Purpose!
<Hash=0x74A2E2E5>	Grapefruit!
<Hash=0x49558795>	Do it!
<Hash=0x465582DC>	Bad idea!
<Hash=0xF5F403E2>	OK, seriously though, all I heard was GRROOAAANN!!
<Hash=0xF1F3FD96>	Ah, wait... I think I've got it. You just said "I'm a 15 year old ferret!" right?
<Hash=0xDF7E5B99>	Well hi there, sugar! How can I help you?
<Hash=0xDC7E56E0>	Well I didn't want to hurt Ghoulia's feelin's none but I'm kinda embarrassed to say I don't understand zombie.
<Hash=0xB004DED1>	I reckon I could but who's going to teach me?
<Hash=0xAD04DA18>	Aw shoot, she's busier than a three-tongued frog in a room full of flies. Hey, wait a minute...
<Hash=0xEB7E6E7D>	Slomo offered me lessons a while ago, but I turned them down. I guess we could find out if he's still interested in teaching me. If Slomo is willing to give me a second chance, it would be total aces in my book.
<Hash=0xDA72E622>	Probably nothing, but I sure do love the song that this character is singin'!
<Hash=0x146A667F>	What about a singer that can change people's moods simply by humming the purrrfect tune?
<Hash=0xF915614>	It'd be pretty hard to ignore that kind of publicity! But who's gonna dress up as <heroname>?
<Hash=0x12915ACD>	Wow! Hun, you look just about ready to dole out some justice!
<Hash=0x3AF7B716>	I still think a musical number would be aces.
<Hash=0x3EF7BD62>	Well, in my spare time I've been trying my hand at designing a few scary-cool rock-a-billy posters for <heroname>.
<Hash=0x33E17098>	You know, I had no idea that comic books could bring people together like this.
<Hash=0xB1A18E7B>	You should come back tomorrow and help to judge the dresses. I'll send you a message about it.
<Hash=0xBF9DEEB6>	I wouldn't call it 'hot'.
<Hash=0xC49DF695>	Meow. Someone's ready to scratch.
<Hash=0xC69DF9BB>	I don't know ghoul, it all feels a little sharp to me.
<Hash=0x10149586>	This is not my color.
<Hash=0xCD61B5C>	Such a hair-raising task, she means. But if anyone is up to the challenge, I'm sure it's <name>.
<Hash=0xA20D2C97>	Wow... now that's one fiery personality.
<Hash=0x9F0D27DE>	I guess we'll give you ghouls some time alone.
<Hash=0x8D61510>	Well Skelita? We're ready... Are you?
<Hash=0x17D62CAD>	The trim reminds me of a gnarly ball of yarn. I can't believe I'm saying this but... I kind of like it.
<Hash=0x280B629>	I'm so glad all of this nonsense is over.
<Hash=0xF9E7AB0C>	Deuce has to owe someone a favor. Who can we get to convince him to join the team?
<Hash=0x83EAC2E1>	Good luck, kitten. You'll need it in that kitchen.
<Hash=0x8703B24C>	Where are we going to come up with those?
<Hash=0x4B3DEF77>	One of us here damaged that dress, and I'm not afraid to scratch around until we find out who it was.
<Hash=0x4D3DF29D>	Well, I was here this morning and saw the dress intact. That means, whatever happened to it occurred during Lunch.
<Hash=0x463DE798>	<name>	is here to dig up the real dirt and figure this out.
<Hash=0x483DEABE>	She's not a Fashion Club member, she can tell who's being a conniving kitty.
<Hash=0x433DE2DF>	I was in the level 2 hallway with Toralei and Meowlody, like we do every day.
<Hash=0xCC278215>	Nice try, kitten.
<Hash=0xB9455866>	What happened?
<Hash=0x939F9C62>	Skelita's dress has been shredded. Know anything about it, Jinafire?
<Hash=0xBA431B62>	Looks like someone needs to be a little more scareful around the merchandise...
<Hash=0xBE4321AE>	The beast part of all of this? It wasn't my fault this time.
<Hash=0x59B83CFB>	The runway is calling...
<Hash=0x68B3A13A>	What if I told you that Scorchio Fearmani is using the Slomix for his next show.
<Hash=0x5DB38FE9>	And Scorchio paid him a ton of money. Lucky for us, we can use it for free.
<Hash=0x76C7FDF>	I could really use a cat nap after all of this.
<Hash=0x708CB65E>	Excellent! Now hurry, go get changed!
<Hash=0x43DD27B1>	You want to borrow <robotname>? No, see it doesn't work like that. <robotname>	has a mind of its own. If you want its help, you'll just have to ask.
<Hash=0x45DD2AD7>	<name>	wants to know if you could help down in the kitchen.
<Hash=0x47DD2DFD>	Well, aren't you a lucky ghoul?
<Hash=0xA67781C2>	OK so then we connect the blue wire to the transistor...
<Hash=0x218FF6>	We need 3 of these brass cogs to make the legs work. Will you find them?
<Hash=0xBFD07AA3>	Great! Come back when you've got them and we'll make the legs work.
<Hash=0xC0D07C36>	Oh, I understand. Come back if you change your mind.
<Hash=0xFF218E63>	You managed to find the cogs? That's wonderful!
<Hash=0x52197D5>	Now we can put them in and get these legs walking!
<Hash=0x221931C>	We'll need to hook up the circuitry though. Catty, want to do it?
<Hash=0x8219C8E>	Alright... <name>, you're up!
<Hash=0x9219E21>	Hah! Look at that, the legs work!
<Hash=0x991EAF3A>	Thanks <name>. You're welcome back to the Robotics club anytime you'd like.
<Hash=0xA4777E9C>	Hi! Do you have an interest in robotics?
<Hash=0xD916C535>	That's great! We could always use an extra pair of hands to help out.
<Hash=0xD616C07C>	That's a shame, but maybe I can convince you that Robots are creepy-cool.
<Hash=0xAE778E5A>	Not as hard as you think, Clawd. But we're missing some important parts right now. Actually, <name>! You can help us find the parts!
<Hash=0x2D4FCBD3>	Welcome back, <name>. We were just talking about arms and elbows.
<Hash=0xA1A822E5>	You're a life saver <name>. Thank you!
<Hash=0x9EA81E2C>	I guess you're busy. Come back when you're not. We could use your help.
<Hash=0x359DF333>	You found the wires! Now we can make those arms work!
<Hash=0x349DF1A0>	Everyone gather round. <name>	is going to show us how to connect the circuits. Just like last time, <name>.
<Hash=0x3A9DFB12>	Fangtastic, <name>. I'll finish up with this part. Come back tomorrow and help us build more.
<Hash=0x2F4FCEF9>	Sure! But something like that is more than just engineering.
<Hash=0x314FD21F>	Well, the arms could make the movements, but the Robot needs to know what the movements are.
<Hash=0x334FD545>	Exactly! Once it has power and memory we can teach it anything. But we're getting ahead of ourselves, right now we need...
<Hash=0x344FD6D8>	Oh rivets, we're out of copper wire!
<Hash=0x7431FFE>	Sure fearly is. Thanks <name>! You really came through for us. We just need to hook up the circuitry.
<Hash=0x9432324>	Such a well-oiled mind!
<Hash=0xC4327DD>	That's exactly right, Catty. OK everyone, that's it for now. We'll meet up again tomorrow and talk about how Robots learn!
<Hash=0x51EBDBB1>	Yeah, they're kinda hard to come by. All robots need them, but active robots use them to pep themselves up.
<Hash=0x53EBDED7>	Errr... Sort of. Anyway, this is why they're hard to come by.
<Hash=0x55EBE1FD>	Not a chance. We're kinda stuck at this point until we find some power cells. Fortunately for us, <name>. has been pretty resourceful.
<Hash=0x54EBE06A>	What do you say, <name>? Will you help us find the power cells?
<Hash=0xA62EFF93>	Clawsome! Come back when you've got them. Thanks <name>.
<Hash=0xA72F0126>	Deary me, we may have to give up on the robot. Let me know if you change your mind.
<Hash=0xD66384C9>	We almost have everything in place for our Robot.
<Hash=0x79AA5721>	Let's get these chips hooked up. You know what to do, <name>.
<Hash=0x78AA558E>	And we're done!
<Hash=0x7CAA5BDA>	It's a new Robot. It doesn't understand us just yet, but it will.
<Hash=0x6EAA45D0>	That's right. It has the mind of a newborn child, only faster.
<Hash=0xE7A2B586>	It'll take a while before the Robot understands things. Come check it out tomorrow after it's had a night to develop.
<Hash=0xD9638982>	Not yet, Heath. The Robot doesn't remember anything, so it needs memory chips.
<Hash=0xD763865C>	Yeah, but we don't have enough. We'll need a few more.
<Hash=0xD86387EF>	<name>, I remember seeing some memory chips in the classrooms around the school. Would you get them for us?
<Hash=0x16BD4300>	Fangtastic! Once we have them, the Robot will begin to learn things.
<Hash=0xB66BE9E7>	Oh, we're missing one last piece of the puzzle. A robot core, but they're really hard to find.
<Hash=0xB16BE208>	With that core, <robotname>	will be able to move just like us.
<Hash=0xB26BE39B>	<name>, you've already done so much, but could you find the Robot Core?
<Hash=0xCDD1BF7C>	Excellent! Bring it back here when you find it!
<Hash=0xD0D1C435>	Oh you must be busy. That's OK. Let me know when you're free.
<Hash=0x783BF95B>	It's alright, Robot. This is a friend. Hey, <name>. We're just having a chat with our Robot friend here.
<Hash=0xB169A371>	You found the core! <robotname>, did you hear that?
<Hash=0xAF69A04B>	Yeah... mine too. OK, <name>, let's hook it up just like we've done before.
<Hash=0xA96996D9>	You're a free robot now, <robotname>.
<Hash=0xAC675CFB>	Just come see me if you need any maintenance, and hey... maybe you could do the same for me some time.
<Hash=0xB16764DA>	Thank you, <name>. We're definitely all getting A's for this project... and we all made a couple of new friends. Fangtastic job, everyone.
<Hash=0x7B3BFE14>	Good question! We hadn't thought of a name. <name>, you collected most of the parts, how about you name it?
<Hash=0x78580095>	That's a riveting name! <robotname>	it is!
<Hash=0x7557FBDC>	Well then how about you choose your own name, Robot?
<Hash=0x81FBA771>	Ask what?
<Hash=0x83FBAA97>	<name>	gave me life. I'll do whatever I can to help. I'll go. See you in the kitchen.
<Hash=0x77FB97B3>	Food prepared. Can I be of any further service?
<Hash=0x836DEB5E>	Hello <name>	This is my first Fashion Show.
<Hash=0x856DEE84>	It would be this robot's scream come true.
<Hash=0xEA3A80C7>	Bzzzzt. Geeeeeeee.
<Hash=0x5741E823>	F----as-----ter
<Hash=0xE46DC3E3>	MONSTER ALERT!
<Hash=0xFBFE1511>	I liked it when the Catty called me the Amazing. Can this be my name?
<Hash=0x69CB4203>	Why can't I dance like the Catty says?
<Hash=0x6FCB4B75>	Calculating...
<Hash=0x6ECB49E2>	There is a spare Robot Core in the Mad Science room.
<Hash=0x72CD8EC5>	My chips are trembling with excitement.
<Hash=0x70CD8B9F>	I ... feel.... different.
<Hash=0x7ACD9B5D>	Free... to what?
<Hash=0xF9D0A1E1>	Of course I will. You... you made me be... it's the least I could do.
<Hash=0xFBD0A507>	<name>... You gave me life... Thank you. I will always be your friend.
<Hash=0xE76DC89C>	1872. My turn for a question. What is <name>?
<Hash=0xE96DCBC2>	What is my name?
<Hash=0x814CA21A>	Ello, eez there someone out there? I am stuck inside zee crypt! All I remember eez looking at those stone gargoyles out there and then this door opened up! Zee last color I remember seeing was Green.
<Hash=0x6A3C7A1>	Wait, I think I remember that zee first color I looked at was Yellow! Look at zee yellow gargoyle first!
<Hash=0x3A3C2E8>	Hm, let's think... The first eez Yellow, and the last eez Green. But what goes in between?
<Hash=0x804EDF1E>	Thank you... Oh, you look just like zee hero! What eez your name?
<Hash=0x7E4EDBF8>	Merci boo-coup, <heroname>! You saved moi!
<Hash=0xCE33BCD8>	Oh, that's easy! The first thing that needs to be done is to repair the Casketball Scoreboard. I'll tell you, as Head of Student Safety I've been complaining about that thing for ages! One of these days it'll fall onto the Fearleading Team - then maybe someone will do something about it!!!
<Hash=0x611CB384>	Things might be changing around Monster High. A Student Council that actually listens to the students - Fangtastic!!!
<Hash=0xF2CA8741>	Wait... we are talking about zee giant carnivorous plant, no?
<Hash=0xF0CA841B>	Sounds quite dangerous to have something like this at school. Is there any... how do you say... danger, to zee students?
<Hash=0xEECA80F5>	Oh I will be sure to put it in zee paper, but I am definitely writing my own story on this.
<Hash=0x74FC9546>	Oh, sure, I'll print your article in zee paper. Just give me a copy of it and I'll make sure it's published immediatement!
<Hash=0x693D05EB>	Bonjour, Venus! What are you doing here?
<Hash=0x4AA1C85D>	Ah bon?! I do not know what you are talking about Venus.
<Hash=0xB5A92C93>	Oui, that is big of you, ghoul. But please do not ever use that pollen on me again. I would like to keep my memories right where they are.
<Hash=0x596C8B70>	Well you look fun! Of course I'd love to read the comic book club's book once it's finished! My ghoulfriends will get a kick out of this.
<Hash=0x14C6BBDA>	Not really, I find it more rude than anything else.
<Hash=0xEA0CB798>	Mi abuela always says to step back and let cooler heads prevail... Wait... Hola? Were you listening to us just now?
<Hash=0x770A2D0D>	Perfecto! You can help us decide!
<Hash=0x740A2854>	OK, well while you're here, can we get your opinion on something.
<Hash=0xED0CBC51>	Which one of these colors do you think is the hottest color this season?
<Hash=0xF00CC10A>	Jinafire, it's alright! Let us both make a dress? I'll make one in <player chosen color>, and you make one in <non-chosen color>.
<Hash=0xE20CAB00>	Let the Fashion Games begin! Thank you for your input <name>.
<Hash=0xE30CAC93>	The beast part about Jinafire is that her heart is always in the right place.
<Hash=0x74179117>	And my suggestion?
<Hash=0x25DA955D>	Mi madre. I love my whole family, but this color always reminds me of her.
<Hash=0x1ADA840C>	Please don't take it personally, Jinafire. You worked so hard and it really does show.
<Hash=0x14D3BED5>	<name>, would you talk to Jinafire? Her passhion makes her just a little sensitive about her work.
<Hash=0xDD3B3D0>	Jinafire has so much energy to give.
<Hash=0x3EB12057>	Flattery won't work here, Purrsephone.
<Hash=0x3AB11A0B>	Si, but we have one problem. We forgot the models.
<Hash=0x737EDE1>	Fashion Club just isn't the same without you there.
<Hash=0x9634FD67>	Jinafire and I have been beasties a long time. I'm just glad she's feeling better about the whole thing.
<Hash=0xBE28C190>	Hey Jinafire...
<Hash=0x3E80B5AD>	What if we ask the Cooking Club?
<Hash=0x889BEA6B>	Could you ask Deuce for the Cooking Club's help?
<Hash=0xF49ED306>	I'm trying to think of a backup plan, just in case the Cooking Club says no.
<Hash=0x1DDF5646>	We want everyone to feel comfortable, like a family at home.
<Hash=0xC27A9CA4>	<sob>... Who could have done this!?
<Hash=0x4C0C1D04>	Um, first I was reading News Feed when Jinafire asked to hang out. We ended up in the Foyer just chatting.
<Hash=0x260A06F8>	Why would I ruin my own dress!?
<Hash=0x480C16B8>	<gasp>	Marisol, no!
<Hash=0xC47A9FCA>	It's ruined! <sob>	My dress is ruined!
<Hash=0x4709D68E>	Why didn't you just say something?
<Hash=0x4509D368>	Not if it was an accident, like you say... But I'm going to have to work my fingers to the bone to fix it.
<Hash=0x4C09DE6D>	We don't have much time, if we're going to fix this, we better get started.
<Hash=0x4909D9B4>	There's no point staying upset. She apologized and that's what's important.
<Hash=0xBE7A9658>	The show... it's over!
<Hash=0xBA7A900C>	The show is tomorrow!
<Hash=0x5C73EEBB>	Shouldn't we ask him first?
<Hash=0x5E73F1E1>	Maybe, but we should find out.
<Hash=0xF38F3250>	Hm... I'm with Jinafire on this one... Slomix is a nice song... but for a runway?
<Hash=0xCA6C4D20>	Slomix is going to be a great song for the runway. I'll have to say thank you to Holt for letting us use it.
<Hash=0xFA8F3D55>	Wha!? The 'Scorchio'?
<Hash=0x9967AD2E>	I don't believe this...
<Hash=0x943579A2>	My dress looked fangtastic up there!
<Hash=0x96333E31>	Your dress looked awesome too, Jinafire. The last touches you put on it really pushed it to the next level.
<Hash=0x94333B0B>	We really do! <name>, this would have been a terror without your help.
<Hash=0x9A33447D>	Now that the show is over, I'm going to start working on a Verdant dress. This one will pull inspiration from mi padre.
<Hash=0x9767AA08>	We forgot to get a ghoul to model our clothes!!
<Hash=0x9C67B1E7>	Wait... what about our model from the other day? Come on, <name>, will you do it?
<Hash=0xC1247758>	We couldn't have done it without you, <name>.
<Hash=0xC4247C11>	Oh no... We're ruined! What are we going to do!?
<Hash=0xFCFE4E9B>	Yeah, it's just disrespectful.
<Hash=0x35C38531>	GROOOOAANN (Hm? Operetta wants a zombie tutor? I can help, but you know what they say... if you're good at something then you never do it for free. I'm going to ask her for singing lessons in return. I've always pictured myself commanding a creepy-cool stage.)
<Hash=0x33C3820B>	GROOOAAANN!! (She said it is defrightful to have you with us.)
<Hash=0x38C389EA>	GROOOAAANN!! (Of course. She is giving me singing lessons out of this.)

<Hash=0x52E79A6B>	GROAAANNN!! (So what did you think? Pretty good right. Anyway, thanks again.)
<Hash=0xD7DDF8FA>	Yes, oh exultant one! I have personally been assisting Queen Cleo in isolating students and then converting them to our cause. Currently, approximately a third of the students at Monster High have been cursed and are under Spookenkhamun's control. By the end of the week, it will be almost over!
<Hash=0xA3F9245F>	You heard her everyone! Let's go!!!
<Hash=0xC370D065>	Who's in there? I can't see who it is. How am I supposed to tell people about this? The comic book club looks like they're having some spooktacular fun with this.
<Hash=0x24954BBF>	Angel food cake!
<Hash=0x98D0F0D>	It's great to see ya again. I'm glad you decided to join the Student Council. I look forward to working with you on some of our projects. I've got a good feeling about this year.

<Hash=0xA8E111F5>	So what do we do now!? I want hot tub, I want hot tub, I want hot tub! Ugh... feeling woozy!
<Hash=0xB456F4F7>	Oh! Oh! Oh!
<Hash=0xB256F1D1>	Sphinxy tells Spectra to keep extra Treasure... It's destiny for Council build big hot tub or maybe big Pyramid in Pool. We earn lots o bubbles, no troubles... Spend 'em Ra-Ra on precious hooooot tuuuub and Pyyyrrraaammiidddss, Abbey make 'em happen!!!
<Hash=0x4B07607E>	Sticking up flyers around the school - cool! It's the perfect opportunity to eavesdrop on some juicy news for my blog.
<Hash=0xBF176374>	Yeah! I'm over the Sphinx!
<Hash=0xBC175EBB>	Hoook'em, Spoook'em, Pyramid Head! Better stop the Curse, or we'll wind up Dead. Ra! Ra! Rescue Team-Ghoul for the School. Only A-newbie-yes, can save us all!!!
<Hash=0xBA175B95>	Ummm... yeah. Good idea... Sure, I'm OK, why do you ask?
<Hash=0x484B63F9>	Gimme that money!!! The Lords of the Nile demand that only she who is chosen by the Sphinx herself, may handle the Treasure of Kings...
<Hash=0x5AA93836>	Come on, hand it over quickly... the Master demands it!
<Hash=0x59A936A3>	Ooooohh... you're gonna pay for that! The Sphinx never forgets, you'll be sorry!!!
<Hash=0x42EFA8CC>	Can I have one of the cookies? They look sooo good, and they smell die-lish! Mmmmmmmmm, taaassstttyyy!!!
<Hash=0x40EFA5A6>	Sooorrrrryyyyyy!!!
<Hash=0x3EEFA280>	Can I have a cookie? Pleeeaaassseee!!!
<Hash=0x4D8B8FBC>	NO!!! I have to do it, I am the chosen one! The Sphinx told me to protect the Treasure of Kings. It's my destiny! The New Ghoul can't be trusted, give me the money... I'll take it! I'll look after it!
<Hash=0x508B9475>	What's up ghouls? Why's everyone staring at me like that? I didn't do something weird did I? That would be embarrassing...
<Hash=0xF4036E5A>	I want to protect the Treasure. Pleeeaaase let me handle the Money. I'll guard it with my life!!!
<Hash=0xF4123765>	Me too, me too!!! The Master demands it. Must have cookies!
<Hash=0xF11232AC>	Sooorrrrryyyyyy!!!
<Hash=0xC76A6DD7>	Hey there, you must be the New Ghoul, Bloodgood told me all about you. It's really great to meet you, it'll be fun showing you around while I scope out all the latest news around Monster High. My first piece of advice is to join at least one of the many Clubs at Monster High. It's a great way to meet new people with similar interests and get more involved with what's happening at the school. For instance, it looks like you've got something going on in the style department. With that sorta passion for fashion, you could be a big hit in the Fashion Club. Do you think you might be interested?
<Hash=0x96862570>	Not your thing? No probs, there is a bunch of other clubs on Campus. Everything from a Cooking Club and Robotics Club to the Comic Book Club. The two most popular clubs are the Student Council - of which I'm a member - and the Fearleading Squad. If you tried out for either of these, I think you'd fit right in...
<Hash=0x99862A29>	Well, there is a bunch of other clubs on Campus. Everything from Robotics and Cooking to the Comic Book Club which Ghoulia runs. The two most popular clubs at Monster High are the Student Council - of which I'm a member - and the Fearleading Squad. If you tried out for either of these, I think you'd really enjoy it!
<Hash=0xC36A678B>	It's my pleasure... Now my second piece of advice is that you can never have too many friends, and I've got a couple of people in mind, for you to meet. Would you like to join and meet a few of my friends?
<Hash=0xC16A6465>	Awww... come on, it'll be a real blast! You guys will get along like a house on fire - in a good way, that is! I'm sure you'll hit it off straight away. It's not far, what've you got to lose?
<Hash=0xC2682761>	My friends are just over there...
<Hash=0xC16825CE>	Hey Draculaura, this is the New Ghoul. I was telling her all about you and the Fearleaders. I thought you ghouls should hook up. Do you think you could keep her company, while I get some research done for my blog? She seems quite interested in joining the Fearleading Team, so you should have a lot to talk about.
<Hash=0x8F31B623>	Sorry, did you say something? What's going on? I was on my way to the bathroom... then everything went all fuzzy. What am I doing here? Why's there an alarm blaring? I need to get outta here!!!
<Hash=0x9DDDFBCF>	(cough, cough, cough) Urgh!!!

IT IS I, KING SPOOKENKHAMUN!!! I WELCOME YOU MY SUBJECTS, ON THIS, THE MOST MOMENTOUS OF DAYS! FOR THE FIRST TIME, MY POWERS HAVE ALLOWED ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU DIRECTLY, THROUGH THIS FELINE VESSEL, A SACRED SISTER OF THE SPHINX. BUT, I SHALL KEEP THINGS SHORT. TODAY WE SPEAK OF HOW TO BRING THE REMAINING STUDENTS INTO THE FOLD, AND MY PLANS TO TAKE OVER AS THE NEW HEADMASTER AT MONSTER HIGH. TODAY THE SCHOOL, TOMORROW THE WORLD!!!
<Hash=0xA3DE0541>	THE PLAN IS SIMPLE... WE WILL STAGE A MASS CURSING DURING THE FEARLEADING MONSTER NATIONALS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST EVENTS OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, SO EVERYONE WILL BE THERE. ALL IN ONE PLACE, NO LESS! IT'S ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!!

WHEN OUR FAVE CURSED FEARLEADING TEAM LED BY QUEEN CLEO, DEMOLISH THEIR OPPONENTS AND WIN THE TOURNAMENT, WE WILL MAKE OUR MOVE! WHILE THE ADORING CROWD CHEERS, TOTALLY DISTRACTED BY WHAT IS GOING ON, WE WILL LOCK THE GYM DOORS TRAPPING THEM INSIDE.

THEN MY CURSED SUBJECTS, YOU WILL SUBDUE ANY OF THE UNINFECTED STUDENTS, WHILE CLEO CURSES THEM ONE-BY-ONE, USING MY MYSTICAL AMULET! IT WILL BE LIKE SHOOTING FISH IN A BARREL, ONLY FAR MORE SATISFYING!!!

THIS IS THE PLAN... NOW MAKE IT SO!!!
<Hash=0x2FDB59D7>	BACK AGAIN... IT'S YOUR HOST WITH THE MOST, KING "SPOOK'EM" SPOOKENKHAMUN!!! I'D LIKE YOU ALL TO GIVE IT UP FOR MONSTER HIGH'S VERY OWN FEARLEADERS, QUEEN CLEO & THE CURSED ONES!!!
<Hash=0x3A4E81EC>	NNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
<Hash=0x31DB5CFD>	WOW!!! JUST LOOK AT THAT SCORE... 10! 9! 10! AMAAAZING! THEY'RE A SMASH! LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD TO CHECK OUT THE CURRENT LEADER IN THE COMPETITION... AND YES, I'M HAPPY TO SAY IT'S CLEO & THE CURSED ONES!
<Hash=0x2BDB538B>	WAIT A MINUTE! THERE IS A LATE SURPRISE ENTRY TO THE COMPETITION... IT'S THE LAST TEAM OF THE DAY AND THEY'RE THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN CLEO & THE CURSED ONES AND THE MONSTER NATIONAL TROPHY!

INCREDIBLY, IT'S ANOTHER FEARLEADING TEAM FROM MONSTER HIGH, SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR 'THE A-NILE-8-ORS'!!!

<Hash=0x23687C5A>	Some more text.
<Hash=0x22687AC7>	Even more text.
<Hash=0x67C0CC7D>	This meeting of the Cursed Council is now in session. There are no un-cursed students present, so please speak freely. It won't be long now, before all the students are... One of us... One of us... One of us...
<Hash=0x63C0C631>	Silence!!! In the name of the great King Spookenkhamun, I demand it! Now, onto the business at hand... Spectra, Catrine, have all the arrangements been made?
<Hash=0x61C0C30B>	Excellent! Our master will be pleased! Catrine, has the message been sent throughout the student body? We must be sure that all the cursed students will be there for the Spookenkhamun rally. There the master will channel himself through me and speak to his loyal subjects directly...
<Hash=0x5FC0BFE5>	Good! Good! Once the plan is set in motion, the un-cursed at Monster High won't know what has hit them, until it's too late. By that time, our master Spookenkhamun will already have control of the school! At lunch my friends... At lunch the fuse will be lit with Spookenkhamun's rallying call and we will be truly unstoppable! Now go, this meeting is adjourned!
<Hash=0xD8BB3040>	Whoah!!! That was weird... OK, LISTEN UP EVERYONE! You've all heard what our master, King Spookenkhamun has ordered. It is time to put these plans into motion. Each of you knows the role you will play in the overall scheme. Go now, do what you must and we will all reign victorious under Spookenkhamun's rule!!!
<Hash=0xA0DA0CC9>	The winners of the Fearleading Monster Nationals with an amazing perfect score are THE A-NILE-8-ORS. Take a bow ghouls, you did it!
<Hash=0xDFAD9077>	It's a nomination that's well deserved... (whispered) and it'll keep anyone suspicious about how I became Prez, off my back... (normal) So, let's take it to a vote.
<Hash=0xE0AD920A>	All those in favor of Lagoona in the position of Vice President, raise your hand.
<Hash=0xE1AD939D>	All those opposed... raise your hand.
<Hash=0x4433300D>	OK, that's 5 to 1 in favor. The motion is passed. Clawsome! Now onto the next order of business. What should be our first Council project? Suggestions anyone?
<Hash=0x41332B54>	OK, that's 4 to 2 in favor. The motion is passed. Great! Now onto the next order of business. What should be our first Council project? Suggestions anyone?
<Hash=0xDDAD8D51>	OH, COME ON!!! It's not like there aren't tons of great ideas, we just need one or two to get the ball rolling? I say we sleep on it. Everyone put on your thinking caps and we'll re-convene tomorrow MORNING. See you all tomorrow. Meeting adjourned!
<Hash=0xAAB9591>	Welcome to the Student Council. I hope you're ready to do some good things at Monster High, if not, it's probably time to leave...
<Hash=0x3CFA2267>	OK... That's enough jabbering! Everyone, take your seats. This meeting of the Student Council is in session...
<Hash=0x3BFA20D4>	Now, to the first order of business. The role of Vice President is up for election again. We need to decide which member of the Council should take on the role. As Prez, I'd like to put forward Lagoona as my right-hand-ghoul...
<Hash=0xDBCCAB95>	Uggh Ruuur... Pyramid sauce!
<Hash=0xDACCAA02>	Urrrgghh!!!! Not feeling well... My head feels like it's gonna explode! Urp!!! OOOhhhh... this 'aint good. OK! Look ghouls, I feel like death warmed up. <laughs>... Urp! Yep! Need some Pyramid pie and a good 'ol cat-nap... Noooooooo!!! By Sphinx, not going to be able to do this today... Urgh! Let's reschedule for tomorrow. I'd better crash out before I start to puke fur balls!!!
<Hash=0xD5F39997>	Good morning everyone, I'm really sorry about yesterday. All of my planets musta been outta alignment and Horus was screeching in my ear. KA-KA, KA-KA, KA-KA, KA-KA!!! Man it gave me the heebie-jeebs. So, what was I saying? Oh, yeah... you're probably wondering how the Snake Sale went. Gotta love those cookie cats. Ummmm, yeah... So to cover all that stuff, better than I ever could, is our Count-skull treasure-roar Abbey the gabby!!!
<Hash=0x717ADB99>	ENOUGH!!! I am Student Disembodied President and what I say goes! This Queen of the Council decrees we're keeping the extra treasure and using it to build a hot tub... maybe even a Pyramid in the pool... or whatever else I want, do not test my patience!
<Hash=0x6F7AD873>	Vote, sh-moat... boat, coat... Hmmm... moat... we could use one of those if the students ever rise up against the Council!!! Note to self. Build moat...
<Hash=0x7D7AEE7D>	Oh, very well then! If that is what it will take to silence you do-gooders, then ye shall have it! All those in favor of Pyramid Hats and Scarab Flavoured Ice Cream raise your hand.
<Hash=0x7B7D29EE>	Ah! Yes! All those in favor of keeping the extra fundraising Money so the Council can build a hot tub, Moat, Pyramid or anything else we want, raise your hand...
<Hash=0x7C7D2B81>	All those opposed...
<Hash=0x797D26C8>	That's 3 in Favor, 3 against. It's a tie! Well, I hope you're all happy now. That didn't achieve anything. We're right back where we started - sheesh!
<Hash=0x7F7D303A>	OK then, we'll postpone the vote until the next Council meeting. Hopefully - the Sphinx willing - someone will come to their senses and we'll get this sorted!
<Hash=0x7D7D2D14>	YES! YES! YES! By her majesty's pet Asp, do I have to do everything around here?! Take the funds for the Casketball Court to Bloodgood. Give the extra Treasure to Catrine and Spectra to protect. Blah, blah, blah...get it, gone! Meeting adjourned! Please leave!!!
<Hash=0xD3F39671>	Hey, that's not a such bad idea! Haven't us Pharaohs... er... Council members, earned ourselves a bit of a treat? I mean, we're the ones who worked like weredogs. Posting flyers around the school. Pushing those huge stone blocks. Selling cookies. Building pyramids... Why not keep the extra cash and spend it on ourselves?
<Hash=0xCDF38CFF>	Why? It's not like anyone can stop us!
<Hash=0x83C4C3F5>	All in favor of removing the New Ghoul and Lagoona from the Council, raise your hands.
<Hash=0xF6BB51EA>	All those opposed...
<Hash=0xF5BB5057>	That's 6 in favour, 0 against. A unanimous decision, that's what I like to see! HAIL TO THE KING, KITTY! WE WIN!!! See ya, see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya... New Ghoul. Lagoona. You must now leave the Council, your privileges have been revoked!
<Hash=0x7EC4BC16>	That's 5 in favor, 1 against. A landslide!!! WE WIN! See ya later alligator... New Ghoul. Lagoona. You can leave now. Your Council privileges have been revoked!
<Hash=0x2D7BB7D3>	Sit down, ghouls... Let's get this over with quickly. Meeting of the Pharaoh's... er Council is in session. Picking up from where we left off at yesterday's meeting, we need to vote on what to do with the extra treasure!
<Hash=0x327BBFB2>	Let's not waste time here!!! I have far more important things to do like feed the Sphinx. Meeting in session. Blah, blah-deddy, blah, blah... time to vote!!!
<Hash=0x307BBC8C>	All in favor of keeping the treasure for ourselves, building a hot tub, putting a Pyramid in the Pool, taking over the school and doing whatever else we feel like, raise your hand...
<Hash=0x377BC791>	All those opposed...
<Hash=0x367BC5FE>	That's 4 in favor, 2 against. It's a landslide!!! WE WIN! Hot tub, here we come... Next order of business... Removal of troublesome members of the Student Council!
<Hash=0x80E1781>	Hey! Alright everyone, take your seats. It's time to get started.
<Hash=0x5F2F4BA3>	Now, that's been decided, each of you have an important task to complete. I expect each Council member to speak with at least 3 different students before the next meeting. We will use the information we gather to decide the Council's next step. Well, that's it for today. Meeting adjourned!
<Hash=0x50E12C8>	This meeting is now in session. During yesterday's meeting, we really hit a wall when it came to ideas. Unfortunately, we really didn't know what to do. So, did anyone come up with anything?
<Hash=0xB0E1C3A>	No? Nothing? Anybody, else? Yes! Abbey, what do you think we should do?
<Hash=0x90E1914>	Hmmm... So, what you're saying is that we hit the corridors of Monster High and talk to the Students to find out what they need and want. That's brilliant! The popularity of each item can decide the priority of each project. I like it a lot! We give the power to the people...
<Hash=0xA0E1AA7>	This could be a real winner! How about we take a vote? All those in favor of surveying the students and allowing them to choose the projects the Council will implement, raise your hand.
<Hash=0x9E1A9418>	That's 5 to 1 in favor. The motion is passed. The Council will launch an Awareness Campaign. Our objective is to roam the halls of Monster High, speaking to students to find out what they need and want, so we can improve their overall school experience.
<Hash=0xA11A98D1>	That's 4 to 2 in favor. The motion is passed. The Council will launch an Awareness Campaign. Our objective is to roam the halls of Monster High, speaking to students to find out what they need and want, so we can improve their overall school experience.
<Hash=0xAE724C6>	OK, down to business. This meeting of the Student Council is now in session. Sooo, Lagoona how did we go in our data gathering mission with the Student Body?
<Hash=0x1DDF2C1C>	Anyone else? Come on, there's gotta be something better than taxing the toilets, that just 'aint gonna work! Hey Ghoul, did you say something?
<Hash=0x774CE5B5>	Nothing? Anybody? Ah, Lagoona! What's your fundraising idea?
<Hash=0x744CE0FC>	A Bake Sale! That's a monstrous idea, I'm disappointed I didn't think of it myself.
<Hash=0x19DF25D0>	That's a fangtastic idea! I'm just disappointed that I didn't come up with it myself.
<Hash=0x1ADF2763>	OK, this looks like a no-brainer, but in the interests of democracy we'll take a vote. All those in favor of a Bake Sale to get funds, raise your hands.
<Hash=0x636D19E4>	Well, so much for "Nay"!!!
<Hash=0x666D1E9D>	That's 5 to 1 in favor of the Bake Sale. The motion is passed. A Bake Sale it is then!
<Hash=0x99DC1DB9>	That's all in favor. The motion is passed with a unanimous decision. Our fundraiser will be a Bake Sale!
<Hash=0x98DC1C26>	OK, now that our fundraiser has been decided upon, we need to choose the best way to get the word out to the Students. Lagoona, how did it go with the ideas on how to get word out to all of the students at Monster High, I asked for?
<Hash=0x96DC1900>	So, what about the actual flyers?
<Hash=0x9CDC2272>	Fangtastic! So we're ready to go then. Each Council member will take some flyers and post up at least 10 of them around the School before tomorrow's meeting. Good work everyone, meeting's adjourned.
<Hash=0xA0DC28BE>	Things are really going well, it's definitely my leadership that's doing the trick!!!
<Hash=0xEE72B12>	That's great! So, did you get a chance to compile the list yet?
<Hash=0xCE727EC>	Thanks for that Lagoona... Great work everyone, that's exactly what we needed. Now, onto the next order of business. How to raise the funds needed to fix these issues?
<Hash=0x13E732F1>	Ideas, anyone?
<Hash=0x59AD09E1>	Oh, it's nothing. You just spaced-out for a minute. Maybe, go and see the school nurse after the meeting's over, just to be safe ghoul. OK then, next item on the agenda...
<Hash=0x58AD084E>	Creepilicious Cookies! We need to get 'em so we can sell 'em. A Bake Sale without baked goods isn't a sale at all. So, can anyone think of a way to get our hands on a bunch of Creepilicious Cookies on the cheap? How about you New Ghoul? You're always full of good ideas.
<Hash=0xBB5F51EB>	Of course! The Cooking Club. Why didn't I think of that? Better still, Deuce owes me a couple of favors, so I'll call one of 'em in...
<Hash=0xBC5F537E>	Too bad... Anybody else? Abbey why dontcha give it to us! What's your clawsome idea for coming by cookies?
<Hash=0x5CAD0E9A>	That's perfect! Deuce owes me a few favors, so I'll call one of them in...
<Hash=0x5BAD0D07>	Well, that's it for today ghouls. Just before we go, New Ghoul, can I count on you to go and speak to Deuce at the Cooking Club to see if they can bake the Creepilicious Cookies?
<Hash=0xBB5285F8>	Great! Thank's for that, and remember, if Deuce is hesitant to help us out, remind him that he owes Toralei one. He'll know what it means and it should seal the deal. OK, meeting's adjourned. See you all at the fundraiser tomorrow.
<Hash=0xBE528AB1>	Oh, come on Ghoul! That's a terrible attitude. Anyone ever tell you there's no 'I' in Team? No? Well I don't really care, so get to it! I'm ordering you to help the Council out, go and speak to Deuce now!
<Hash=0xDF80C3C4>	This Council meeting is now in session. So everyone, how did everything go with the flyers? Any feedback from the students yet? Catrine, what did you want to say?
<Hash=0xE180C6EA>	That's fangtastic! Anyone else with something to add? Spectra.
<Hash=0xD380B0E0>	Ahhhh! Sure Spectra, that helps a lot... You feeling OK, ghoul? Maybe you should try posting that up on your blog?
<Hash=0x5FF86690>	OK everyone, we've got a busy day ahead, so we'd better get a move on! On that note, the meeting is now in session. As you can probably smell - hmmmmmmm - Deuce brought in a bunch of Creepilicious Cookies that the Cooking Club baked up for the fundraiser. Now all we have to do is sell them! Lagoona, could you please outline everyone's sale positions for us?
<Hash=0x68F874BB>	Just ignore her Lagoona. I think she's cracking up, must be all that blogging she does messing with her brain! We don't have time for this! That's it everyone, let's go sell some cookies!!!
<Hash=0xB2309B15>	Good morning everyone, this Council meeting is now in session. No doubt, all of you are interested to hear about how yesterday's fundraising effort went. To give you the low-down on all the financial deets, I'll hand you over to Abbey our Treasurer...
<Hash=0xB03097EF>	Good work everyone! It's great to see all of you pulling together as a team. Now, just one more pressing matter before we break for the day. Ghoul would you be able deliver the funds to Headmistress Bloodgood, so that all of the improvements and repairs can be started?
<Hash=0xAB309010>	Yeah, ghoul! Take a chill-pill and have a lie down. I think the pressure's getting to ya.
<Hash=0xB930A61A>	It's nothing Spectra. I think we're all just tired. It was a really big day yesterday, I think we've all earned ourselves an early break. Meeting adjourned!
<Hash=0xD5A7AB7A>	Good morning everyone, the Council meeting is now in session. I have some great news! Last night the contractors came in and revamped the Creepateria. Now it has a huge flat-screen TV mounted to the wall, comfy new chairs, and all the Vending Machines have been fixed and are full of tasty BooBoo Fruits! Lagoona. Do we have any feedback from the students yet?
<Hash=0xA1F2A711>	So, does anyone have any suggestions about the type of cookie that we should sell? Catrine, what are your thoughts?
<Hash=0x9FF2A3EB>	I like it! It ties in nicely and clearly gets the message out. Are there any objections to selling Casketball Cookies at the next fundraiser? No? Excellent! Casketball cookies it is. Sooo... next on the agenda is flyers. Lagoona, you did such a fangtastic job of the flyers last time, would you be happy to do them again?
<Hash=0xA5F2AD5D>	Now, that's what I call initiative! Clawsome work Lagoona!!! That means we're ready to go. Time to post some flyers! Same deal team, but let's up the ante a little. This time around, each Council member will post up at least 15 flyers around the School. This should be done before tomorrow's meeting. Good work everyone, meeting's adjourned.
<Hash=0xD3A7A854>	That's totally clawsome! Well, I guess we'd better keep up the good work then. So what's the next item which needs our attention?
<Hash=0xD1A7A52E>	We should start planning our next Fundraiser to raise Money so that we can fix-up the Casketball Court. Are there any objections? No? Well let's get to work then...
<Hash=0xD0A7A39B>	We'll stick with what worked so well last time. So, it'll be another Bake Sale, we'll advertise using flyers again and with a little luck it'll be another HUGE success! Is there anything anyone thinks we should change this time around? Yes... Spectra?
<Hash=0xCDA79EE2>	Anybody else? Yes, Abbey...
<Hash=0x39C45D2F>	This meeting of the Student Council is now in session. So everyone, how did everything go with the flyers yesterday? Has there been any student feedback yet? Lagoona.
<Hash=0x3BC46055>	Clawsome! Anyone else with something to add? No. OK, on to the next item of business, getting the cookies. New Ghoul, do you mind hitting up Deuce again, to see if the Cooking Club will help out?
<Hash=0x35C456E3>	Well, that's about everything then! OK Team, go home and get some rest. You're gonna need it! Tomorrow's Bake Sale, should be even bigger than the last one. Meeting adjourned!
<Hash=0x5D3B6D94>	We've got a busy day ahead of us Team! But this time, we do know what to expect, so we're far better prepared. On that note, the meeting is now in session. Once again, Deuce and the Cooking Club have come up with the goods. They've baked almost twice as many cookies this time around, so with a little luck we won't sell out. Lagoona, what are we doing with the sale positions?
<Hash=0x553B60FC>	OK, that's it people, time to sell some cookies!!!
<Hash=0xF4E45BCD>	Well there's only one other person that knows my locker code... Howleen.
<Hash=0xEFE453EE>	Oh, you found my sand! Thank you!

Hey Gigi, you still want to be a normie?
<Hash=0xEDE450C8>	Oh sure, you can change to any Monster Type whenever you want!
<Hash=0xEBE44DA2>	There! You're a normie! How do you feel?
<Hash=0x51920AC2>	That's pretty weird. Did you grant the wish?
<Hash=0x5BE73C89>	Alright.
<Hash=0x58E737D0>	How about you <name>? Want to be a different Monster Type?
<Hash=0x890B8A19>	Scary-cool! We're going to change your Monster Type, ok?
<Hash=0x860B8560>	OK that's cool. Some monsters are just happy in their skin. Well, now that I have the bag back you can come change your Monster Type whenever you like. Just come and find me.
<Hash=0x5FE742D5>	Hey, you're back! Do you want to change your monster type?
<Hash=0x4B920150>	Well maybe I can help. My Boogeyman Sand is pretty powerful stuff. We can use it to switch Monster Type.
<Hash=0x4D920476>	Of course! It's in my locker, I'll go get it.
<Hash=0x57921434>	It's gone!!
<Hash=0xD8100D20>	Looks like some kind of hero!
<Hash=0xDA101046>	She can fly!!!
<Hash=0xBE1721FC>	Thanks so much for asking. Hands down it's gotta be those revolting chairs in the Creepateria. For a Plant Monster like myself, I can't go near them, much less sit on them - they're toxic!!! If you can fix that, I'd be ever so thankful. Oh, and a big TV on the wall so we can watch Ever After High, that would be freaky-fab!!!
<Hash=0x19987C18>	Wow! This is something new. The Student Council asking us what we need. Totally cool!
<Hash=0x5BECC2BB>	Creepy-cool, your flower is growing quite nicely.
<Hash=0x44B6471D>	Awww weeds! This whole situation is becoming quite a thorn in my side.
<Hash=0x42B643F7>	Oh dear, another mess. <name>, why don't you decide who gets the plant food? Iris or Gilda?
<Hash=0x5EECC774>	It's not a competition, ghouls. Besides, we don't even have any more plant food.
<Hash=0x174D3E02>	I know... it's monstrous!
<Hash=0xE48B2A9>	Don't be a shrinking violet, Iris. Your garden will catch up soon enough.
<Hash=0xD51072F>	Don't worry, Jane. Carnivorous plants get a bad reputation because of the Carnivore side, but they're really quite gentle.
<Hash=0xF510A55>	You're right! Information is key to proper plant care. I need to talk to someone at the Gory Gazette... I'll be back!
<Hash=0x95100E3>	Remember to use soothing words, then pat it twice, use more soothing words and pat it again.
<Hash=0xB510409>	Yes! And it's spooktacular!
<Hash=0x155113C7>	Not if everyone follows these instructions! Maybe we could get the word out in the Gory Gazette?
<Hash=0x9B4997F4>	Sunsational! Thanks Rochelle!
<Hash=0x9C499987>	<name>, did you hear that? We're going to be in the paper. Oh. Em. Gore. This is exciting! Come and see us tomorrow.
<Hash=0xEF4C5AC7>	That's not unnatural... IT'S MAGNIFICENT!
<Hash=0xC043C205>	No, I think Jane's right. It's just... enormous! It's... MAGNIFICENT!
<Hash=0xAD9BCEF9>	Guys, we've got maybe the rarest plant in the world to grow over 10 feet tall!
<Hash=0xAB9BCBD3>	It's a Carnivorous Cellaphod!
<Hash=0xB36617EC>	This is just maddening! Have you read this article? Do you see what Rochelle is saying about our garden?
<Hash=0x45B78F54>	I just wanted to have a chat about my plant article in the paper. Perhaps there's another way I could persuade you to print it?
<Hash=0x47B7927A>	Great, thank you Rochelle. I'm thrilled to hear that you're finally seeing things my way.
<Hash=0xB5661B12>	Right here... it says "Plants of all sizes are great, until they can eat the roof off your house."
<Hash=0xAF6611A0>	That's discrimination against plants!
<Hash=0xB16614C6>	There's no danger if you know how to look after it... cross my vines!
<Hash=0xCA5AD762>	But how?
<Hash=0xC75AD2A9>	You're right, but I don't want to go alone. I need a strong wing-ghoul to meet me in the Study Howl, and help me through it. <name>, it'd be a lot easier to face this with you by my side. Meet me there when you get the chance.
<Hash=0xC45ACDF0>	I have a confession to make. I used my pollen to persuade Rochelle to print my version of a story in the paper.
<Hash=0xD35AE58D>	The pollen can have an effect on your memory, Rochelle. It will come back to you in a couple of days. I am so sorry, ghoul. I got so passionate that I just... I'm sorry.
<Hash=0x30EE71FA>	What's up, ghouls?
<Hash=0xD25D2291>	You can count on it, ghoul! I've definitely learned my lesson. My friends helped me to see that using my powers on other monsters is wrong.
<Hash=0xD05D1F6B>	Yeah, they're the best. I really should go and tell them that.
<Hash=0xD55D274A>	Thanks <name>. And actually thanks to all of you. You helped me instead of pushing me away and I really appreciate it.
<Hash=0xD35D2424>	Yes! No pollen on other monsters. Period.
<Hash=0xC95D1466>	So it can stay!?
<Hash=0x57603287>	Spooktacular!!!
<Hash=0x2AEE6888>	My chat? I'm not sure what you're talking about.
<Hash=0x2CEE6BAE>	OK, I did, but I had a very good reason! Rochelle wasn't seeing the bigger picture here.
<Hash=0x26EE623C>	It's not like I did anything bad. I just swapped the story she was writing for the paper with one that I wrote.
