# hunkfile
Torus Games data format packer-unpacker. Tested on Monster High NGIS PC game. Make sure you are using correct endianness (ps3 hunkfiles are big endian, pc are little). 

`HunkfileCodec.py` contains actually working code, everything else in root directory is garbage.
Ask me if you need any help
